AT1G13980,EMB30,"Encodes a GDP/GTP exchange factor for small G-proteins of the ADP ribosylation factor (RAF) class, and as regulator of intracellular trafficking. Homologous to Sec7p and YEC2 from yeast. Involved in the specification of apical-basal pattern formation. Essential for cell division, expansion and adhesion. It appears that heteotypic binding between the DCB and C-terminal domains of two GNOM proteins is required for membrane association, however, GNOM appears to exist predominantly as a heterodimer formed through DCB-DCB interactions.",NM_001198062,837958,3702.AT1G13980.1,NA,-0.135369176,0.019281094,-0.638305284,-0.039734042,-0.815551331,-0.301143827,-0.056377397,0.48453191,-0.318090844,-0.398531657,-0.154981326,0.15465027,-0.502936107,0.095635135,-0.680182155,-0.165774651,0.07899178,0.619901086,-0.182721667,-0.263162481,-0.019612149,-0.657586377,-0.059015135,-0.834832425,-0.32042492,-0.07565849,0.465250817,-0.337371937,-0.417812751,-0.174262419,0.598571242,-0.177246048,0.337161457,0.581927887,1.122837194,0.32021444,0.239773626,0.483323958,-0.77581729,-0.261409785,-0.016643355,0.524265952,-0.278356802,-0.358797616,-0.115247284,0.514407504,0.759173934,1.300083241,0.497460488,0.417019674,0.660570005,0.24476643,0.785675737,-0.016947017,-0.09738783,0.146162501,0.540909307,-0.261713447,-0.342154261,-0.098603929,-0.802622754,-0.883063567,-0.639513236,-0.080440814,0.163109518,0.243550332,0.135369176,-0.019281094,0.638305284,0.039734042,0.815551331,0.301143827,0.056377397,-0.48453191,0.318090844,0.398531657,0.154981326,-0.15465027,0.502936107,-0.095635135,0.680182155,0.165774651,-0.07899178,-0.619901086,0.182721667,0.263162481,0.019612149,0.657586377,0.059015135,0.834832425,0.32042492,0.07565849,-0.465250817,0.337371937,0.417812751,0.174262419,-0.598571242,0.177246048,-0.337161457,-0.581927887,-1.122837194,-0.32021444,-0.239773626,-0.483323958,0.77581729,0.261409785,0.016643355,-0.524265952,0.278356802,0.358797616,0.115247284,-0.514407504,-0.759173934,-1.300083241,-0.497460488,-0.417019674,-0.660570005,-0.24476643,-0.785675737,0.016947017,0.09738783,-0.146162501,-0.540909307,0.261713447,0.342154261,0.098603929,0.802622754,0.883063567,0.639513236,0.080440814,-0.163109518,-0.243550332

AT3G56960,PIP5K4,Encodes a protein with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase activity that plays a role in pollen tip growth. The enzyme localizes to the apical plasma membrane and adjacent cytosolic region of pollen tubes.
