AT5G39510,ATVTI11,Encodes a member of SNARE gene family.  Homologous with yeast VTI1 and is involved in vesicle transport. Mutant alleles such as sgr4/zig are defective in the shoots response to gravity resulting in a zigzag growth pattern of the stem. Involved in protein trafficking to lytic vacuoles. Can conditionally substitute VTI12 in protein storage vacuole trafficking when plants are devoid of VTI12.,NM_123313,833947,3702.AT5G39510.1,"GO:0005484, GO:0005488, GO:0005515, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005768, GO:0005783, GO:0005794, GO:0006605, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006996, GO:0008104, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0016020, GO:0016023, GO:0016043, GO:0016192, GO:0031201, GO:0032991, GO:0042175, GO:0043226, GO:0043234, GO:0044464, GO:0051179, GO:0071840",-0.007340006,-0.3995945,0.2200502,-0.5114029,-0.04438206,0.1472328,-0.1387706,-0.2557239,-0.1270139,-0.03820531,0.09106069,-0.3922545,0.2273902,-0.5040629,-0.03704205,0.1545728,-0.1314306,-0.2483839,-0.1196739,-0.0308653,0.09840069,0.6196447,-0.1118084,0.3552125,0.5468274,0.260824,0.1438706,0.2725806,0.3613892,0.4906552,-0.731453,-0.2644322,-0.07281732,-0.3588207,-0.4757741,-0.347064,-0.2582555,-0.1289895,0.4670208,0.6586357,0.3726323,0.255679,0.384389,0.4731976,0.6024636,0.1916149,-0.09438851,-0.2113419,-0.08263182,0.006176752,0.1354427,-0.2860034,-0.4029567,-0.2742467,-0.1854381,-0.05617214,-0.1169533,0.01175669,0.1005653,0.2298313,0.12871,0.2175186,0.3467846,0.08880858,0.2180746,0.129266,0.007340006,0.3995945,-0.2200502,0.5114029,0.04438206,-0.1472328,0.1387706,0.2557239,0.1270139,0.03820531,-0.09106069,0.3922545,-0.2273902,0.5040629,0.03704205,-0.1545728,0.1314306,0.2483839,0.1196739,0.0308653,-0.09840069,-0.6196447,0.1118084,-0.3552125,-0.5468274,-0.260824,-0.1438706,-0.2725806,-0.3613892,-0.4906552,0.731453,0.2644322,0.07281732,0.3588207,0.4757741,0.347064,0.2582555,0.1289895,-0.4670208,-0.6586357,-0.3726323,-0.255679,-0.384389,-0.4731976,-0.6024636,-0.1916149,0.09438851,0.2113419,0.08263182,-0.006176752,-0.1354427,0.2860034,0.4029567,0.2742467,0.1854381,0.05617214,0.1169533,-0.01175669,-0.1005653,-0.2298313,-0.12871,-0.2175186,-0.3467846,-0.08880858,-0.2180746,-0.129266
