It appears that heteotypic binding between the DCB and C-terminal domains of two GNOM proteins is required for membrane association, however, GNOM appears to exist predominantly as a heterodimer formed through DCB-DCB interactions.",NM_001198062,837958,3702.AT1G13980.1,NA,-0.135369176,0.019281094,-0.638305284,-0.039734042,-0.815551331,-0.301143827,-0.056377397,0.48453191,-0.318090844,-0.398531657,-0.154981326,0.15465027,-0.502936107,0.095635135,-0.680182155,-0.165774651,0.07899178,0.619901086,-0.182721667,-0.263162481,-0.019612149,-0.657586377,-0.059015135,-0.834832425,-0.32042492,-0.07565849,0.465250817,-0.337371937,-0.417812751,-0.174262419,0.598571242,-0.177246048,0.337161457,0.581927887,1.122837194,0.32021444,0.239773626,0.483323958,-0.77581729,-0.261409785,-0.016643355,0.524265952,-0.278356802,-0.358797616,-0.115247284,0.514407504,0.759173934,1.300083241,0.497460488,0.417019674,0.660570005,0.24476643,0.785675737,-0.016947017,-0.09738783,0.146162501,0.540909307,-0.261713447,-0.342154261,-0.098603929,-0.802622754,-0.883063567,-0.639513236,-0.080440814,0.163109518,0.243550332,0.135369176,-0.019281094,0.638305284,0.039734042,0.815551331,0.301143827,0.056377397,-0.48453191,0.318090844,0.398531657,0.154981326,-0.15465027,0.502936107,-0.095635135,0.680182155,0.165774651,-0.07899178,-0.619901086,0.182721667,0.263162481,0.019612149,0.657586377,0.059015135,0.834832425,0.32042492,0.07565849,-0.465250817,0.337371937,0.417812751,0.174262419,-0.598571242,0.177246048,-0.337161457,-0.581927887,-1.122837194,-0.32021444,-0.239773626,-0.483323958,0.77581729,0.261409785,0.016643355,-0.524265952,0.278356802,0.358797616,0.115247284,-0.514407504,-0.759173934,-1.300083241,-0.497460488,-0.417019674,-0.660570005,-0.24476643,-0.785675737,0.016947017,0.09738783,-0.146162501,-0.540909307,0.261713447,0.342154261,0.098603929,0.802622754,0.883063567,0.639513236,0.080440814,-0.163109518,-0.243550332

AT3G11820,AT-SYR1,"Encodes a syntaxin localized at the plasma membrane (SYR1, Syntaxin Related Protein 1, also known as SYP121, PENETRATION1/PEN1).  SYR1/PEN1 is a member of the SNARE superfamily proteins.  SNARE proteins are involved in cell signaling, vesicle traffic, growth and development.  SYR1/PEN1 functions in positioning anchoring of the KAT1 K+ channel protein at the plasma membrane. Transcription is upregulated by abscisic acid, suggesting a role in ABA signaling.  Also functions in non-host resistance against barley powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis sp. hordei.  SYR1/PEN1 is a nonessential component of the preinvasive resistance against Colletotrichum fungus.

AT3G60190,ADL1E,"At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central dynamin 2 domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.
