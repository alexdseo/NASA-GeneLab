AT3G60190,ADL1E,"At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central dynamin 2 domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.",NM_115882,825189,3702.AT3G60190.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0003924, GO:0005198, GO:0005200, GO:0005488, GO:0005515, GO:0005622, GO:0005856, GO:0005874, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006897, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0016043, GO:0016192, GO:0016787, GO:0032502, GO:0032989, GO:0008152, GO:0044464, GO:0051179",0.919323211,0.366588304,0.99912088,-0.552734907,0.079797669,0.632532576,-0.919323211,-0.366588304,-0.99912088,0.552734907,-0.079797669,-0.632532576
