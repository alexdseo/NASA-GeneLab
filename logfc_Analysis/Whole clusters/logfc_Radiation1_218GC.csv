Acts as a negative regulator of phyB signalling. It degrades rapidly after irradiation of dark grown seedlings in a process controlled by phytochromes. Does not play a  significant role in controlling light input and function of the circadian  clockwork. Binds to G- and E-boxes, but not to other ACEs. Binds to anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a light- and HY5-independent fashion. PIF3 function as a transcriptional activator can be functionally and mechanistically separated from its role in repression of PhyB mediated processes.",NM_001331836,837479,3702.AT1G14700.1,NA,2.500758264,-0.16835704,2.949360064,-2.669115304,0.4486018,3.117717104,-2.500758264,0.16835704,-2.949360064,2.669115304,-0.4486018,-3.117717104

This gene is expressed in all tissues examined, but most abundantly expressed in upper stems.

AT1G59640,BPE,"A basic helix-loop-helix encoding gene (BIGPETAL, BPE) involved in the control of petal size. BPE is expressed via two mRNAs derived from an alternative splicing event. The BPEub (AT1G59640.1)transcript is expressed ubiquitously, whereas the BPEp (AT1G59640.2) transcript is preferentially expressed in petals. Plants that lack the petal-expressed variant BPEp have larger petals as a result of increased cell size.

AT2G20180,PIF1,"Encodes a novel Myc-related bHLH transcription factor that has transcriptional activation activity in the dark.  It is a key negative regulator of phytochrome-mediated seed germination and acts by inhibiting chlorophyll biosynthesis, light-mediated suppression of hypocotyl elongation and far-red light-mediated suppression of seed germination, and promoting negative gravitropism in hypocotyls.  Light reduces this activity in a phy-dependent manner.

It falls into one subclass with AGP18 and AGP19, other lysine-rich AGPs. 84% of its proline residues are hydroxylated to hydroproline and its heavy glycosylation accounts for appr. 69% of the molecular weight. The main glycosyl residues are arabinose (30.1%) and galactose (55.1%). Glycosyl linkages are consistent with type II arabinogalactans. AGP17 is predicted to have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)anchor and is localized to the plasma membrane and Hechtian strands.

AT2G33460,RIC1,encodes a member of a novel protein family that contains contain a CRIB (for Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding) motif required for their specific interaction with GTP-bound Rop1 (plant-specific Rho GTPase). Interacts with Rop1 and is involved in pollen tube growth and function. Protein most similar to RIC3(family subgroup III). RIC1 is localized to the apical region of the plasma membrane in pollen tube and mutation analyses indicate that this localization is dependent on ROP1 binding. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined.Analysis of overexpression and loss of function mutants indicates a role in cortical microtubule organization during pavement cell morphogenesis.,NM_128906,817911,3702.AT2G33460.1,"GO:0005198, GO:0005200, GO:0005622, GO:0005856, NA",2.975696968,-0.100628926,2.825363592,-3.076325894,-0.150333376,2.925992518,-2.975696968,0.100628926,-2.825363592,3.076325894,0.150333376,-2.925992518

Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1. PID autophosphorylation is required for the ability of PID to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. PID activation loop is required for PDK1-dependent PID phosphorylation and requires the PIF domain.

A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).",NM_001336695,818412,3702.AT2G38320.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005794, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016407, GO:0016740, GO:0016746, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",-0.524032311,0.015655163,-0.510322067,0.539687474,0.013710244,-0.52597723,0.524032311,-0.015655163,0.510322067,-0.539687474,-0.013710244,0.52597723

AT3G05630,PDLZ2,Encodes a member of the PXPH-PLD subfamily of phospholipase D proteins.  Regulates vesicle trafficking. Required for auxin transport and distribution and hence auxin responses. This subfamily is novel structurally different from the majority of plant PLDs by having phox homology (PX) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains.  Involved regulating root development in response to nutrient limitation.  Plays a major role in phosphatidic acid production during phosphate deprivation. Induced upon Pi starvation in both shoots and roots. Involved in hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine to produce diacylglycerol for digalactosyldiacylglycerol synthesis and free Pi to sustain other  Pi-requiring processes.

AT3G14370,WAG2,"The WAG2 and its homolog, WAG1 each encodes protein-serine/threonine kinase that are nearly 70% identical to PsPK3 protein. All three together with CsPK3 belong to PsPK3-type kinases. At the N-terminus, all four possess a serine/threonine-rich domain. They are closely related to Arabidopsis kinases PINOID. wag1/wag2 double mutants exhibit a pronounced wavy root phenotype when grown vertically on agar plates (while wild-type plants develop wavy roots only on plates inclined to angles less than 90 degrees), indicating an overlapping role for WAG1 and WAG2 as suppressors of root waving. Simultaneous disruption of PID(AT2G34650) and its 3 closest homologs (PID2/AT2G26700, WAG1/AT1G53700, and WAG2/AT3G14370) abolishes the formation of cotyledons.",NM_112295,820658,3702.AT3G14370.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0004672, GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0005737, GO:0005886, GO:0006464, GO:0006468, GO:0006796, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016020, GO:0016301, GO:0016740, GO:0019538, GO:0035556, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0065007, NA",-1.235731464,-0.323032469,-1.219966009,0.912698995,0.015765455,-0.89693354,1.235731464,0.323032469,1.219966009,-0.912698995,-0.015765455,0.89693354

AT3G47450,ATNOA1,"Encodes a protein with similarity to the bacterial YqeH GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. In Arabidopsis, mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling in plants. It also attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence and cell death. This gene product is also involved in nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.",NM_114613,823899,3702.AT3G47450.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0003924, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005739, GO:0006139, GO:0006796, GO:0006807, GO:0008152, GO:0009056, GO:0009987, GO:0016462, GO:0016787, GO:0043226, GO:0044085, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",3.002984241,-0.089208078,2.927388449,-3.092192318,-0.075595792,3.016596526,-3.002984241,0.089208078,-2.927388449,3.092192318,0.075595792,-3.016596526

The root phenotypes can be traced to abnormalities in asymmetric divisions in the pericycle and root apex.

AT4G24250,ATMLO13,"A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO13 belongs to the clade II, with ATMLO1 and ATMLO15. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root and cotyledon vascular system, in pollen and also in placenta of developing siliques, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).",NM_001341655,828526,3702.AT4G24250.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-2.095035906,-0.177870248,-2.020224919,1.917165658,0.074810987,-1.842354671,2.095035906,0.177870248,2.020224919,-1.917165658,-0.074810987,1.842354671
