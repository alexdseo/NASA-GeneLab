Induced by salicylic acid. Independent of NPR1 for their induction by salicylic acid. UGT1 encodes a protein with glucosyltransferase activity with high sequence homology to UGT2 (AT1G05530). It belongs to an UGT subfamily that binds UDP-glucose but not UDP-glucuronate, UDP-galactose, or UDP-rhamnose as the glycosyl donor. UGT1 was shown to be able to use abscisic acid as glycosylation substrate in the presence of UDP-glucose.

"422","AT1G23260","MMZ1","MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.","NM_001332597",838935,"3702.AT1G23260.1","GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006464, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0019538, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",0.294982503,0.200926885,0.36154492,-0.094055618,0.066562417,0.160618034,-0.294982503,-0.200926885,-0.36154492,0.094055618,-0.066562417,-0.160618034

TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).","NM_104762",842373,"3702.AT1G60790.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005794, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016407, GO:0016740, GO:0016746, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",0.416794926,-0.084793986,0.36672738,-0.501588912,-0.050067546,0.451521366,-0.416794926,0.084793986,-0.36672738,0.501588912,0.050067546,-0.451521366

Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.","NM_001084328",843224,"3702.AT1G68910.1",NA,0.505452168,-0.040822244,0.388476334,-0.546274412,-0.116975834,0.429298578,-0.505452168,0.040822244,-0.388476334,0.546274412,0.116975834,-0.429298578

"959","AT1G70560","CKRC1","TAA1 is involved in the shade-induced production of indole-3-pyruvate (IPA), a precursor to IAA, a biologically active auxin. It is also involved in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development from embryogenesis to flower formation and plays a role in ethylene-mediated signaling. This enzyme can catalyze the formation of IPA from L-tryptophan. Though L-Trp is expected to be the preferred substrate in vivo, TAA1 also acts as an aminotransferase using L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Leu, L-Ala, L-Met, and L-Gln.","NM_105724",843393,"3702.AT1G70560.1","GO:0003824, GO:0006520, GO:0006778, GO:0006807, GO:0008152, GO:0008483, GO:0016740, GO:0044238",0.941747117,-0.116234316,0.924502868,-1.057981433,-0.017244249,1.040737184,-0.941747117,0.116234316,-0.924502868,1.057981433,0.017244249,-1.040737184

"1000","AT1G72970","EDA17","Originally identified as a mutation that causes floral organs to fuse together. About 10-20% of mutants also have defects in ovules. Mutants have reduced fertility most likely as because of fusions that pistil emergence. The protein has similarity to the mandelonitrile lyase family of FAD containing oxidoreductases and is predicted to be secreted (SignalP).It is expressed in all tissue layers of roots, inflorescences, stems, leaves, and flowers and is also expressed in siliques. Expression is highest in inflorescence and flower tissue.Transmission of mutant alleles to the progeny shows non mendelian segregation- a percentage of mutant alleles revert back to a previous parental (e.g. grandparental) wild type allele. It has been suggested that an RNA template driven or other extra-DNA genomic mechanism may be responsible for the non-mendelian inheritance of HTH. Reversion events in alleles at other loci have also been observed to occur in plants with an hth mutant background indicating a genome wide effect.","NM_001160997",843628,"3702.AT1G72970.1","GO:0003824, GO:0006091, GO:0008152, GO:0016491, GO:0022904",2.54973329,-0.387031499,2.481027141,-2.936764789,-0.06870615,2.86805864,-2.54973329,0.387031499,-2.481027141,2.936764789,0.06870615,-2.86805864

"1728","AT2G44110","ATMLO15","A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO15 belongs to the clade II, with ATMLO13 and ATMLO15. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root tips and flower (papillae, anthers and pollen grains), as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).","NM_129974",819017,"3702.AT2G44110.2","GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-9.712292745,0.044008835,-9.764733362,9.75630158,-0.052440617,-9.808742197,9.712292745,-0.044008835,9.764733362,-9.75630158,0.052440617,9.808742197

GPA1 (in its GTP-bound state) affects the GTP binding and GTPase activity of GTG2 and may act to down-regulate GTG2 binding to ABA. GTG2 is widely expressed throughout the plant and appears to be involved in the regulation of several ABA-dependent responses including seed germination, plant development, and promotion of stomatal closure. GTG2 transcript levels do not appear to change in response to ABA or abiotic stresses.","NM_001203925",828874,"3702.AT4G27630.3",NA,-0.262708178,0.041299249,-0.179283219,0.304007427,0.083424959,-0.220582467,0.262708178,-0.041299249,0.179283219,-0.304007427,-0.083424959,0.220582467

This phenotype is consistent with the hypothesized function of RPD1 in the maintenance of active cell proliferation.","NM_148393",829487,"3702.AT4G33495.1",NA,-0.267075891,-0.150158102,-0.107400932,0.116917788,0.159674958,0.04275717,0.267075891,0.150158102,0.107400932,-0.116917788,-0.159674958,-0.04275717
