AT1G29400,AML5,"A member of mei2-like gene family, predominantly plant-based family of genes encoding RNA binding proteins with characteristic presence of a highly conserved RNA binding motif first described in the mei2 gene of the fission yeast S. pombe. In silico analyses reveal nine mei2 -like genes in A. thaliana. They were grouped into four distinct clades, based on overall sequence similarity and subfamily-specific sequence elements. AML5 is a member of two sister clades of mei2-like gene family, AML1 through AML5, and belongs to the clade named ALM235. Among mei2-like genes, AML5 is the transcript with highest frequency of alternative splicing.

ATMLO10 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO5, AtMLO7, AtMLO8, and AtMLO9. The gene is expressed in root and cotyledon vascular system, in root-shoot junction and lateral root primordia and in developing siliques, as shown by GUS activity patterns.
