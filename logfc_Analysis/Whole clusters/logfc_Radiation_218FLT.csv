AT1G12480,CDI3,"Encodes a membrane protein with 10 predicted transmembrane helices. SLAC1 is a multispanning  membrane protein  expressed predominantly in guard cells that plays a role in regulating cellular ion homeostasis and S-type anion currents. SLAC1 is important for normal stomatal closure in response to a variety of signals including elevated CO2, ozone, ABA, darkness, and humidity. SLAC1:GFP localizes to the plasma membrane.",NM_101120,837805,3702.AT1G12480.1,NA,6.339012903,-0.490758367,6.647895201,-6.82977127,0.308882298,7.138653568,-6.339012903,0.490758367,-6.647895201,6.82977127,-0.308882298,-7.138653568

AT1G31880,BRX,"Belongs to five-member BRX gene family. Arabidopsis BRX genes share high levels of similarity among each others, with several conserved domains. The most distinct is BRX domain - highly conserved in all BRX genes among distantly related species. This protein-protein interaction domain is required and sufficient for BRX activity. BRX encodes a key regulator of cell proliferation and elongation in the root, which has been implicated in the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway as well as regulation of auxin-responsive gene expression. Also involved in cytokinin-mediated inhibition of lateral root initiation.  A loss-of-function allele, named brx-2 in   Rodrigues et al.

AT1G61560,ATMLO6,"A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO6 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO2, AtMLO3 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots and lateral root primordia, in flower and fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of cotyledons, young leaves and petals, in mature rosette leaves, in anthers, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).",NM_001198352,842450,3702.AT1G61560.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-3.728303895,0.374535436,-3.815214701,4.102839331,-0.086910806,-4.189750138,3.728303895,-0.374535436,3.815214701,-4.102839331,0.086910806,4.189750138

Mutants are defective in proanthocyanidin synthesis and seed mucilate deposition. Seeds are yellow colored. Seed size is also affected; seeds  are reduced in size but only when the mutant allele is transmitted through the female parent.Loss of function alleles are associated with a reduction in interploidy lethality.,NM_001084546,818303,3702.AT2G37260.1,NA,-0.379145217,0.12767014,-0.644911889,0.506815357,-0.265766672,-0.772582029,0.379145217,-0.12767014,0.644911889,-0.506815357,0.265766672,0.772582029

AT2G39200,ATMLO12,"A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO6 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO2, AtMLO3 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root tips and cotyledon vascular system, in floral organs (anthers and stigma), and in fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).",NM_129478,818505,3702.AT2G39200.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-1.94916108,0.801910058,-2.159458488,2.751071138,-0.210297408,-2.961368546,1.94916108,-0.801910058,2.159458488,-2.751071138,0.210297408,2.961368546

AT3G45290,ATMLO3,"A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO3 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO2, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in primary root and lateral root primordia, in fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of cotyledons and in trichomes of young leaves,; it was not expressed in mature rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).",NM_114398,823667,3702.AT3G45290.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",6.192577826,0.191187186,6.78952039,-6.00139064,0.596942564,6.598333204,-6.192577826,-0.191187186,-6.78952039,6.00139064,-0.596942564,-6.598333204

AT4G25540,ATMSH3,"encodes a DNA mismatch repair homolog of human MutS gene, MSH6. There are four MutS genes in Arabidopsis, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and MSH7, which all act as heterodimers and bind to 51-mer duplexes. MSH2*MSH3 heterodimers bound 'insertion-deletion' DNA with three nucleotides (+AAG) or one nucleotide (+T) looped out much better than they bound DNA with a base/base mispair (T/G).",NM_118686,828659,3702.AT4G25540.1,"GO:0003676, GO:0003677, GO:0003684, GO:0003690, GO:0003824, GO:0005488, GO:0005622, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006796, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0006996, GO:0008152, GO:0009056, GO:0009987, GO:0016043, GO:0016462, GO:0016787, GO:0032991, GO:0043234, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050896, GO:0071840, NA",-0.84633996,0.002696195,-0.969613553,0.849036155,-0.123273592,-0.972309748,0.84633996,-0.002696195,0.969613553,-0.849036155,0.123273592,0.972309748

The gene is expressed in leaves, stems, flowers, seeds and roots and quite strongly in trichomes. There is partial functional redundancy between ATMYB23 and GL1.

AT5G51060,ATRBOHC,RHD2 (along with RHD3 and RHD4) is required for normal root hair elongation. Has NADPH oxidase activity. Gene is expressed in the elongation and differention zone in trichoblasts and elongating root hairs. RDH2 is localized to the growing tips of root hair cells. It is required for the production of reactive oxygen species in response to extracellular ATP stimulus.
