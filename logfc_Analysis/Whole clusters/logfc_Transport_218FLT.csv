Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology.

AT1G42990,ATBZIP60,"AtbZIP60 consists of a bZIP DNA binding domain followed by a putative transmembrane domain. GFP fusions containing the first 260 amino acids (AtbZIP60deltaC) are nuclear-localized. AtbZIP60 is upregulated by the addition of tunicamycin (ER stress response inductor), DTT (inhibitor of disulfide bond formation) and azetin-2-carboxylate (proline analog perturbing protein structure). Upon ER stress the protein is proteolyzed and the soluble part is translocalized into the nucleus. AtbZIP60deltaC can activate the promoters of the ER chaperones BiP1, BiP2 and BiP3 and CNX1 and CNX2 via binding to the ER stress response element (ERSE) and the plant unfolded protein response element(P-UPRE). It can also activate its own transcription.",NM_103458,840897,3702.AT1G42990.1,NA,0.188548371,-0.202008931,0.305316267,-0.390557302,0.116767896,0.507325198,-0.188548371,0.202008931,-0.305316267,0.390557302,-0.116767896,-0.507325198

AT1G50240,FU,"The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, which we named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.",NM_001333427,841446,3702.AT1G50240.2,NA,-0.290085852,-0.136370056,-0.288365347,0.153715796,0.001720505,-0.151995291,0.290085852,0.136370056,0.288365347,-0.153715796,-0.001720505,0.151995291

AT1G54690,G-H2AX,"Encodes HTA3, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 1020 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period.

AT1G57820,ORTH2,"Encodes a 645-amino acid methylcytosine-binding protein with a PHD domain, two RING finger domains, and an SRA domain that is involved in centromere heterochromatinization. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in vitro.  The protein has been shown to bind to methylated cytosines of CG, CNG and CNN motifs via its SRA domain but has a preference for the former. It plays a role in the establishment/maintenance of chromatin structure during cell division and is localized in the nucleus. Plants over-expressing VIM1/ORTH2 show an inhibition in root growth and a delay in flowering. Both over-expression of GFP:ORTH2 and loss of ORTH2/VIM1 lead to decreased levels of DNA methylation. GFP:ORTH2 over-expressers also have increased levels of FWA transcripts.",NM_001333806,842157,3702.AT1G57820.1,"GO:0000228, GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0005694, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006325, GO:0006351, GO:0006464, GO:0006807, GO:0006996, GO:0008152, GO:0009058, GO:0009987, GO:0016043, GO:0016070, GO:0019219, GO:0019538, GO:0040029, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0065007, GO:0071840, NA",0.32200402,-0.175354507,0.10333942,-0.497358527,-0.2186646,0.278693927,-0.32200402,0.175354507,-0.10333942,0.497358527,0.2186646,-0.278693927

AT1G60220,OTS1,"Encodes a deSUMOylating enzyme. In vitro it has both peptidase activity and isopeptidase activity: it can cleave C-terminal residues from SUMO to activate it for attachment to a target protein and it can also act on the isopeptide bond between SUMO and another protein. sGFP:OTS1 protein accumulates in the nucleus. Double mutant analysis with ULP1C/OTS2 indicates that these genes are involved in salt stress responses and flowering time regulation. Over-expression of 35S:OTS1 increases salt tolerance and reduces the level of SUMO-conjugated proteins. OTS1 transcript levels do not appear to change in response to salt, but, salt stress reduces the level of OTS1 protein in a proteasome-dependent manner.",NM_104712,842317,3702.AT1G60220.1,NA,-0.482321056,-0.109150756,-0.504036912,0.3731703,-0.021715856,-0.394886156,0.482321056,0.109150756,0.504036912,-0.3731703,0.021715856,0.394886156

AT1G68910,WIT2,"Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.",NM_001084328,843224,3702.AT1G68910.1,NA,0.505452168,-0.040822244,0.388476334,-0.546274412,-0.116975834,0.429298578,-0.505452168,0.040822244,-0.388476334,0.546274412,0.116975834,-0.429298578

AT1G73590,ATPIN1,"Encodes an auxin efflux carrier involved in shoot and root development. It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development.

AT2G23130,AGP17,"AGP17 is a lysine-rich arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) and part of a multi-gene family of glycoproteins with approx. 50 members. It falls into one subclass with AGP18 and AGP19, other lysine-rich AGPs. 84% of its proline residues are hydroxylated to hydroproline and its heavy glycosylation accounts for appr. 69% of the molecular weight. The main glycosyl residues are arabinose (30.1%) and galactose (55.1%). Glycosyl linkages are consistent with type II arabinogalactans. AGP17 is predicted to have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)anchor and is localized to the plasma membrane and Hechtian strands.

The active GTP-bound form of GPA1 binds to the GTG1 and GTG2 abscisic acid (ABA) receptors and appears to affect their GTPase and GTP-binding activity, and hence, ABA binding abilities. GPA1 is a positive regulator in ABA-mediated inhibition of stomatal opening. Plants with recessive mutant alleles have complex phenotypes including: reduced brassinolide response, reduced cell divisions, round leaves, short hypocotyls.

AT2G33860,ARF3,"ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF.",NM_001336475,817956,3702.AT2G24765.1,NA,0.034797958,-0.055400796,0.17959435,-0.090198754,0.144796392,0.234995146,-0.034797958,0.055400796,-0.17959435,0.090198754,-0.144796392,-0.234995146

AT3G07610,IBM1,"IBM1 likely encodes a protein with histone H3mK9 demethylation activity. It may preferentially demethylate H3mK9 at low-copy loci to protect them from silencing by nearby heterochromatin by preventing the spread of cytosine methylation. BONSAI (At1g73177) is hypermethylated in ibm1 mutants. ibm1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. These phenotypes cannot result solely from the BONSAI hypermethylation. Aberrant phenotypes in ibm1 mutants in both DNA methylation and plant development can be suppressed by mutations in the KYP H3K9 methyltransferase or he CMT3 non CG-cytosine methylase.",NM_001084652,819952,3702.AT3G07610.3,"GO:0003676, GO:0003677, GO:0003700, GO:0005488, GO:0006139, GO:0006351, GO:0006357, GO:0006366, GO:0008152, GO:0044238, GO:0001071, GO:0016070, GO:0019219, GO:0050789, GO:0065007",0.448472432,-0.057296675,0.350192611,-0.505769107,-0.098279821,0.407489286,-0.448472432,0.057296675,-0.350192611,0.505769107,0.098279821,-0.407489286

AT3G10800,BZIP28,"Encodes bZIP28, a putative membrane-tethered transcriptional factor. Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and shares a bZIP domain, transmembrane domain, and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment.",NM_111917,820249,3702.AT3G10800.1,NA,-0.053838343,-0.117305148,-0.111295949,-0.063466806,-0.057457607,0.006009199,0.053838343,0.117305148,0.111295949,0.063466806,0.057457607,-0.006009199

AT3G19050,POK2,"PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN 2 is one of the two Arabidopsis homologs isolated in yeast two-hybrid screen for interaction partners of maize gene TANGLED1 (TAN1). Based on sequence homology in their motor domains, POK1 and POK2 belong to the kinesin-12 class which also includes the well-characterized group of phragmoplast-associated kinesins AtPAKRPs.

RIN4 physically interacts with RPS2 and RPM1 in vivo. Bacterial avirulence (Avr) effectors AvrB, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 induce a mobility shift in RIN4 and expression of AvrRpt2 induces rapid degradation of RIN4. RIN4 contains 2 sites for AvrRpt2 autocleavage, called RCS1 and RCS2. Overexpression of RIN4 inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function and also inhibits PAMP-induced defense signaling. Attached to the plasma membrane at its carboxyl terminus. Cleaved  by AvrRpt2 at two PxFGxW motifs, one releasing a large portion of RIN4 from the  plasma membrane and both exposing amino-terminal residues that destabilized the carboxyl-terminal cleavage products by targeting them for N-end ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation.

AT3G60190,ADL1E,"At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central dynamin 2 domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.",NM_115882,825189,3702.AT3G60190.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0003924, GO:0005198, GO:0005200, GO:0005488, GO:0005515, GO:0005622, GO:0005856, GO:0005874, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006897, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0016043, GO:0016192, GO:0016787, GO:0032502, GO:0032989, GO:0008152, GO:0044464, GO:0051179",0.919323211,0.366588304,0.99912088,-0.552734907,0.079797669,0.632532576,-0.919323211,-0.366588304,-0.99912088,0.552734907,-0.079797669,-0.632532576

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO1 belongs to the clade II, with ATMLO13 and ATMLO15. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root and cotyledon vascular system, in pollen and in papillae, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).",NM_001036501,828229,3702.AT4G02600.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",0.004099238,-0.103949535,-0.029299859,-0.108048774,-0.033399097,0.074649677,-0.004099238,0.103949535,0.029299859,0.108048774,0.033399097,-0.074649677

AT4G22260,IM,"Similar to mitochondrial alternative oxidase.  im mutants have a variegated phenotype and fail to differentiate chloroplasts in the majority of their cells under high light intensity continuous illumination. The white tissues of immutans accumulate phytoene, a non-colored C40 carotenoid intermediate. This suggests that immutans controls, either directly or indirectly, the activity of phytoene desaturase (PDS), the enzyme that converts phytoene to zeta-carotene in higher plants. However, im is not the structural gene for PDS. It is located in the lumenar face of the thylakoid membrane.

Loss of gene function leads to a redistribution of H3K4me3 and K3K36me2 modifications within genes but not a change in the overall abundance of these modifications within chromatin.",NM_119129,829105,3702.AT4G29830.1,NA,0.030958907,-0.035895118,0.050447645,-0.066854025,0.019488739,0.086342764,-0.030958907,0.035895118,-0.050447645,0.066854025,-0.019488739,-0.086342764

AT5G53760,ATMLO11,"A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO11 belongs to the clade I, with AtMLO4 and AtMLO14. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth (in primary root), in root tips and lateral root primordia, and in very young leaves, and in flowers and fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).",NM_001036993,835457,3702.AT5G53760.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-1.037955953,-0.631737766,-1.230652324,0.406218187,-0.192696372,-0.598914559,1.037955953,0.631737766,1.230652324,-0.406218187,0.192696372,0.598914559

AT5G58230,ATMSI1,"Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.",NM_125208,835935,3702.AT5G58230.1,"GO:0000398, GO:0004872, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006325, GO:0006397, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006996, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0016043, GO:0016070, GO:0043574, GO:0044238, GO:0051179",-0.099643668,-0.014759539,-0.141175348,0.084884129,-0.041531679,-0.126415809,0.099643668,0.014759539,0.141175348,-0.084884129,0.041531679,0.126415809
