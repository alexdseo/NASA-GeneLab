AT1G06220,CLO,Encodes a protein with similarity to splicing factor Snu114. Snu114 is thought to be involved in activation of the splicosome. Loss of GFA1 function results in reduced female fertility. Approximately 50% of ovules abort due to defects in the female gametophyte. In mutant gametophytes antipodal cells express egg cell markers suggesting a defect in specification of cell fate.GFA1 is also required to restrict the expression of LIS.,NM_001331621,837131,3702.AT1G06220.1,"GO:0000375, GO:0000398, GO:0003676, GO:0003723, GO:0003746, GO:0003824, GO:0003924, GO:0005488, GO:0005622, GO:0006139, GO:0006397, GO:0006412, GO:0006796, GO:0006807, GO:0008135, GO:0008152, GO:0008380, GO:0009056, GO:0009058, GO:0009987, GO:0016070, GO:0016462, GO:0016787, GO:0019538, GO:0030529, GO:0044238, GO:0044464",0.137764137,0.515044462,-0.071423553,0.386593686,0.149824375,0.463497524,-0.099056375,0.679167817,-0.06263269,-0.098026764,-0.46142474,0.377280325,-0.20918769,0.248829549,0.012060238,0.325733386,-0.236820512,0.54140368,-0.200396827,-0.235790902,-0.599188877,-0.586468015,-0.128450776,-0.365220087,-0.051546939,-0.614100837,0.164123355,-0.577677152,-0.613071226,-0.976469202,0.458017239,0.221247928,0.534921076,-0.027632822,0.75059137,0.008790863,-0.026603212,-0.390001187,-0.236769311,0.076903837,-0.485650061,0.292574131,-0.449226376,-0.48462045,-0.848018426,0.313673149,-0.24888075,0.529343442,-0.212457065,-0.247851139,-0.611249115,-0.562553899,0.215670293,-0.526130214,-0.561524288,-0.924922263,0.778224192,0.036423685,0.001029611,-0.362368365,-0.741800507,-0.777194581,-1.140592556,-0.035394074,-0.39879205,-0.363397975,-0.137764137,-0.515044462,0.071423553,-0.386593686,-0.149824375,-0.463497524,0.099056375,-0.679167817,0.06263269,0.098026764,0.46142474,-0.377280325,0.20918769,-0.248829549,-0.012060238,-0.325733386,0.236820512,-0.54140368,0.200396827,0.235790902,0.599188877,0.586468015,0.128450776,0.365220087,0.051546939,0.614100837,-0.164123355,0.577677152,0.613071226,0.976469202,-0.458017239,-0.221247928,-0.534921076,0.027632822,-0.75059137,-0.008790863,0.026603212,0.390001187,0.236769311,-0.076903837,0.485650061,-0.292574131,0.449226376,0.48462045,0.848018426,-0.313673149,0.24888075,-0.529343442,0.212457065,0.247851139,0.611249115,0.562553899,-0.215670293,0.526130214,0.561524288,0.924922263,-0.778224192,-0.036423685,-0.001029611,0.362368365,0.741800507,0.777194581,1.140592556,0.035394074,0.39879205,0.363397975

AT1G08370,ATDCP1,"Encodes DCP1 involved in mRNA decapping.  DCP1 forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP2 (At5g13570) and VCS (VARICOSE) (At3g13300). However, unlike DCP2, DCP1 itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology.

AT1G11310,ATMLO2,"A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in  A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene,  jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin,  glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.",NM_001123796,837673,3702.AT1G11310.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",0.069210899,0.226387498,0.721979477,-0.045264959,0.317038643,0.111536685,0.477547171,0.059921629,0.152062933,0.289770355,0.741024722,0.157176598,0.652768578,-0.114475858,0.247827743,0.042325786,0.408336272,-0.00928927,0.082852034,0.220559456,0.671813822,0.49559198,-0.271652457,0.090651145,-0.114850812,0.251159674,-0.166465869,-0.074324564,0.063382857,0.514637224,-0.767244436,-0.404940835,-0.610442792,-0.244432306,-0.662057849,-0.569916544,-0.432209122,0.019045244,0.362303602,0.156801644,0.52281213,0.105186588,0.197327892,0.335035314,0.78628968,-0.205501957,0.160508529,-0.257117014,-0.164975709,-0.027268288,0.423986079,0.366010486,-0.051615057,0.040526248,0.17823367,0.629488036,-0.417625543,-0.325484238,-0.187776816,0.26347755,0.092141305,0.229848726,0.681103093,0.137707422,0.588961788,0.451254366,-0.069210899,-0.226387498,-0.721979477,0.045264959,-0.317038643,-0.111536685,-0.477547171,-0.059921629,-0.152062933,-0.289770355,-0.741024722,-0.157176598,-0.652768578,0.114475858,-0.247827743,-0.042325786,-0.408336272,0.00928927,-0.082852034,-0.220559456,-0.671813822,-0.49559198,0.271652457,-0.090651145,0.114850812,-0.251159674,0.166465869,0.074324564,-0.063382857,-0.514637224,0.767244436,0.404940835,0.610442792,0.244432306,0.662057849,0.569916544,0.432209122,-0.019045244,-0.362303602,-0.156801644,-0.52281213,-0.105186588,-0.197327892,-0.335035314,-0.78628968,0.205501957,-0.160508529,0.257117014,0.164975709,0.027268288,-0.423986079,-0.366010486,0.051615057,-0.040526248,-0.17823367,-0.629488036,0.417625543,0.325484238,0.187776816,-0.26347755,-0.092141305,-0.229848726,-0.681103093,-0.137707422,-0.588961788,-0.451254366

AT1G11400,PYM,"The PYM gene encodes a protein capable of interacting with MAGO, and Y14, whose orthologs form part of the exon junction complex in animal cells. In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together. But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times. Its nuclear localization signal has not been rigorously defined, but there is evidence for a nuclear export signal between amino acids 171-205 in the C-terminus.",NM_001035946,837682,3702.AT1G11400.1,,0.159038304,-0.286491593,-0.154837035,-0.121966317,-0.351347809,-0.424505451,0.16961399,0.285117254,0.378746421,0.175686625,0.509638708,-0.445529897,-0.313875339,-0.281004621,-0.510386113,-0.583543755,0.010575686,0.12607895,0.219708117,0.016648321,0.350600404,0.131654558,0.164525276,-0.064856217,-0.138013859,0.456105583,0.571608846,0.665238014,0.462178218,0.7961303,0.032870718,-0.196510774,-0.269668417,0.324451025,0.439954289,0.533583456,0.33052366,0.664475743,-0.229381493,-0.302539135,0.291580307,0.40708357,0.500712738,0.297652942,0.631605024,-0.073157642,0.520961799,0.636465063,0.730094231,0.527034434,0.860986517,0.594119441,0.709622705,0.803251873,0.600192076,0.934144159,0.115503264,0.209132431,0.006072635,0.340024718,0.093629167,-0.109430629,0.224521454,-0.203059796,0.130892286,0.333952083,-0.159038304,0.286491593,0.154837035,0.121966317,0.351347809,0.424505451,-0.16961399,-0.285117254,-0.378746421,-0.175686625,-0.509638708,0.445529897,0.313875339,0.281004621,0.510386113,0.583543755,-0.010575686,-0.12607895,-0.219708117,-0.016648321,-0.350600404,-0.131654558,-0.164525276,0.064856217,0.138013859,-0.456105583,-0.571608846,-0.665238014,-0.462178218,-0.7961303,-0.032870718,0.196510774,0.269668417,-0.324451025,-0.439954289,-0.533583456,-0.33052366,-0.664475743,0.229381493,0.302539135,-0.291580307,-0.40708357,-0.500712738,-0.297652942,-0.631605024,0.073157642,-0.520961799,-0.636465063,-0.730094231,-0.527034434,-0.860986517,-0.594119441,-0.709622705,-0.803251873,-0.600192076,-0.934144159,-0.115503264,-0.209132431,-0.006072635,-0.340024718,-0.093629167,0.109430629,-0.224521454,0.203059796,-0.130892286,-0.333952083

AT1G23080,ATPIN7,"Encodes a novel component of auxin efflux that is located  apically in the basal cell and is involved during embryogenesis in setting up the apical-basal axis in the embryo.  It is also involved in pattern specification during root development.  In roots, it is expressed at lateral and basal membranes of provascular cells in the meristem and elongation zone, whereas in the columella cells it coincides with the PIN3 domain. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. PINs are directly involved of in catalyzing  cellular auxin efflux.",NM_001084115,838916,3702.AT1G23080.1,"GO:0005215, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005783, GO:0005886, GO:0006810, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009719, GO:0009987, GO:0016020, GO:0022857, GO:0042592, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0051179, GO:0065007, NA",0.467619176,-0.380384787,-0.344726572,0.41379706,-0.912974699,-0.210138966,0.078611467,0.448111432,0.062127271,0.024302371,0.184575053,-0.848003963,-0.812345748,-0.053822115,-1.380593875,-0.677758141,-0.389007708,-0.019507744,-0.405491904,-0.443316805,-0.283044123,0.035658215,0.794181848,-0.532589912,0.170245822,0.458996255,0.828496219,0.442512059,0.404687158,0.564959841,0.758523632,-0.568248127,0.134587606,0.423338039,0.792838004,0.406853843,0.369028943,0.529301625,-1.32677176,-0.623936026,-0.335185593,0.034314371,-0.351669789,-0.38949469,-0.229222007,0.702835734,0.991586167,1.361086131,0.97510197,0.93727707,1.097549752,0.288750433,0.658250397,0.272266237,0.234441336,0.394714019,0.369499964,-0.016484196,-0.054309097,0.105963586,-0.38598416,-0.423809061,-0.263536378,-0.037824901,0.122447782,0.160272682,-0.467619176,0.380384787,0.344726572,-0.41379706,0.912974699,0.210138966,-0.078611467,-0.448111432,-0.062127271,-0.024302371,-0.184575053,0.848003963,0.812345748,0.053822115,1.380593875,0.677758141,0.389007708,0.019507744,0.405491904,0.443316805,0.283044123,-0.035658215,-0.794181848,0.532589912,-0.170245822,-0.458996255,-0.828496219,-0.442512059,-0.404687158,-0.564959841,-0.758523632,0.568248127,-0.134587606,-0.423338039,-0.792838004,-0.406853843,-0.369028943,-0.529301625,1.32677176,0.623936026,0.335185593,-0.034314371,0.351669789,0.38949469,0.229222007,-0.702835734,-0.991586167,-1.361086131,-0.97510197,-0.93727707,-1.097549752,-0.288750433,-0.658250397,-0.272266237,-0.234441336,-0.394714019,-0.369499964,0.016484196,0.054309097,-0.105963586,0.38598416,0.423809061,0.263536378,0.037824901,-0.122447782,-0.160272682

AT1G23260,MMZ1,"MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.",NM_001332597,838935,3702.AT1G23260.1,"GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006464, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0019538, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-0.263185314,-0.366865357,-0.159659992,-0.293396617,-0.200830827,-0.473332775,-0.020835276,-0.457678916,0.0390776,-0.298466169,0.147532832,-0.103680043,0.103525322,-0.030211303,0.062354487,-0.210147461,0.242350038,-0.194493602,0.302262914,-0.035280855,0.410718146,0.207205365,0.07346874,0.16603453,-0.106467418,0.346030082,-0.090813559,0.405942957,0.068399188,0.514398189,-0.133736625,-0.041170835,-0.313672783,0.138824716,-0.298018924,0.198737592,-0.138806177,0.307192824,0.09256579,-0.179936158,0.272561341,-0.164282299,0.332474217,-0.005069552,0.440929449,-0.272501948,0.179995551,-0.256848089,0.239908427,-0.097635342,0.348363659,0.452497499,0.015653859,0.512410375,0.174866606,0.620865607,-0.43684364,0.059912876,-0.277630893,0.168368108,0.496756516,0.159212747,0.605211748,-0.337543769,0.108455232,0.445999001,0.263185314,0.366865357,0.159659992,0.293396617,0.200830827,0.473332775,0.020835276,0.457678916,-0.0390776,0.298466169,-0.147532832,0.103680043,-0.103525322,0.030211303,-0.062354487,0.210147461,-0.242350038,0.194493602,-0.302262914,0.035280855,-0.410718146,-0.207205365,-0.07346874,-0.16603453,0.106467418,-0.346030082,0.090813559,-0.405942957,-0.068399188,-0.514398189,0.133736625,0.041170835,0.313672783,-0.138824716,0.298018924,-0.198737592,0.138806177,-0.307192824,-0.09256579,0.179936158,-0.272561341,0.164282299,-0.332474217,0.005069552,-0.440929449,0.272501948,-0.179995551,0.256848089,-0.239908427,0.097635342,-0.348363659,-0.452497499,-0.015653859,-0.512410375,-0.174866606,-0.620865607,0.43684364,-0.059912876,0.277630893,-0.168368108,-0.496756516,-0.159212747,-0.605211748,0.337543769,-0.108455232,-0.445999001

AT1G29050,TBL38,"Encodes a member of the TBL (TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE) gene family containing a plant-specific DUF231 (domain of unknown function) domain. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).",NM_102646,839779,3702.AT1G29050.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005794, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016407, GO:0016740, GO:0016746, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",0.143105749,-0.197371915,-0.208187317,-0.377884724,-0.091985906,-0.588633348,-0.459310644,-0.649040282,-0.213393415,-0.589476702,0.213575547,-0.340477665,-0.351293067,-0.520990473,-0.235091655,-0.731739097,-0.602416393,-0.792146031,-0.356499164,-0.732582451,0.070469798,-0.010815402,-0.180512809,0.105386009,-0.391261432,-0.261938729,-0.451668367,-0.016021499,-0.392104786,0.410947462,-0.169697407,0.116201411,-0.38044603,-0.251123327,-0.440852965,-0.005206097,-0.381289385,0.421762864,0.285898818,-0.210748624,-0.08142592,-0.271155558,0.164491309,-0.211591978,0.591460271,-0.496647442,-0.367324738,-0.557054376,-0.121407509,-0.497490796,0.305561453,0.129322704,-0.060406934,0.375239933,-0.000843354,0.802208895,-0.189729638,0.245917229,-0.130166058,0.672886191,0.435646867,0.05956358,0.862615829,-0.376083287,0.426968962,0.803052249,-0.143105749,0.197371915,0.208187317,0.377884724,0.091985906,0.588633348,0.459310644,0.649040282,0.213393415,0.589476702,-0.213575547,0.340477665,0.351293067,0.520990473,0.235091655,0.731739097,0.602416393,0.792146031,0.356499164,0.732582451,-0.070469798,0.010815402,0.180512809,-0.105386009,0.391261432,0.261938729,0.451668367,0.016021499,0.392104786,-0.410947462,0.169697407,-0.116201411,0.38044603,0.251123327,0.440852965,0.005206097,0.381289385,-0.421762864,-0.285898818,0.210748624,0.08142592,0.271155558,-0.164491309,0.211591978,-0.591460271,0.496647442,0.367324738,0.557054376,0.121407509,0.497490796,-0.305561453,-0.129322704,0.060406934,-0.375239933,0.000843354,-0.802208895,0.189729638,-0.245917229,0.130166058,-0.672886191,-0.435646867,-0.05956358,-0.862615829,0.376083287,-0.426968962,-0.803052249

AT1G48410,AGO1,"Encodes an RNA Slicer that selectively recruits microRNAs and siRNAs.  There is currently no evidence that AGO1 Slicer is in a high molecular weight RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Mutants are defective in post-transcriptional gene silencing and have pleiotropic developmental and morphological defects. Through its action on the  regulation of ARF17 expression, the protein regulates genes involved at the cross talk between auxin and light signaling during adventitious root development. AGO1 seems to be targeted for degradation by silencing suppressor F-box-containing proteins from Turnip yellow virus and Cucurbit aphid-borne yellow virus.",NM_001198240,841262,3702.AT1G48410.2,NA,0.02782694,0.07138991,-0.2082249,-0.0542138,-0.2715597,-0.1077921,-0.0437513,0.2753472,-0.251849,-0.2111168,-0.5232368,0.04356297,-0.2360518,-0.08204074,-0.2993866,-0.135619,-0.07157825,0.2475203,-0.2796759,-0.2389438,-0.5510637,-0.2796148,-0.1256037,-0.3429496,-0.179182,-0.1151412,0.2039573,-0.3232389,-0.2825067,-0.5946267,0.1540111,-0.06333479,0.1004328,0.1644736,0.4835721,-0.04362409,-0.002891929,-0.3150119,-0.2173459,-0.05357826,0.01046249,0.329561,-0.1976352,-0.156903,-0.469023,0.1637676,0.2278084,0.5469069,0.0197107,0.06044286,-0.2516771,0.06404075,0.3831393,-0.1440569,-0.1033247,-0.4154447,0.3190985,-0.2080977,-0.1673655,-0.4794855,-0.5271962,-0.486464,-0.798584,0.04073216,-0.2713878,-0.31212,-0.02782694,-0.07138991,0.2082249,0.0542138,0.2715597,0.1077921,0.0437513,-0.2753472,0.251849,0.2111168,0.5232368,-0.04356297,0.2360518,0.08204074,0.2993866,0.135619,0.07157825,-0.2475203,0.2796759,0.2389438,0.5510637,0.2796148,0.1256037,0.3429496,0.179182,0.1151412,-0.2039573,0.3232389,0.2825067,0.5946267,-0.1540111,0.06333479,-0.1004328,-0.1644736,-0.4835721,0.04362409,0.002891929,0.3150119,0.2173459,0.05357826,-0.01046249,-0.329561,0.1976352,0.156903,0.469023,-0.1637676,-0.2278084,-0.5469069,-0.0197107,-0.06044286,0.2516771,-0.06404075,-0.3831393,0.1440569,0.1033247,0.4154447,-0.3190985,0.2080977,0.1673655,0.4794855,0.5271962,0.486464,0.798584,-0.04073216,0.2713878,0.31212

AT1G70940,ATPIN3,"A regulator of auxin efflux and involved in differential growth. PIN3 is expressed in gravity-sensing tissues, with PIN3 protein accumulating predominantly at the lateral cell surface. PIN3 localizes to the plasma membrane and to vesicles. In roots, PIN3 is expressed without pronounced polarity in tiers two and three of the columella cells, at the basal side of vascular cells, and to the lateral side of pericycle cells of the elongation zone. PIN3 overexpression inhibits root cell growth.

AT1G72050,TFIIIA,"Encodes a transcriptional factor TFIIIA required for transcription of 5S rRNA gene.  5S rRNA is the smallest constituent of the ribosome.  Work on one of the gene models AT1G72050.2 showed that it encodes a protein with nine Cys(2)-His(2)-type zinc fingers, a characteristic feature of TFIIIA proteins. AT1G72050.2 also contains a 23 amino acid spacer between fingers 1 and 2, a 66 amino acid spacer between fingers 4 and 5, and a 50 amino acid non-finger C-terminal tail.  in vitro assay demonstrated that AT1g72050.2 binds to 5S rDNA  and efficiently stimulates the transcription of 5S rRNA. AT1g72050.2 also binds to 5S rRNA in vitro.

AT1G73590,ATPIN1,"Encodes an auxin efflux carrier involved in shoot and root development. It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development.

AT2G01420,ATPIN4,"Encodes a putative auxin efflux carrier that is localized in developing and mature root meristems.  It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  A role for AtPIN4 in generating a sink for auxin below the quiescent center of the root meristem that is essential for auxin distribution and patterning is proposed. In the root, PIN4 is detected around the quiescent center and cells surrounding it, and localizes basally in provascular cells.

AT2G01570,RGA,"Member of the VHIID/DELLA regulatory family. Contains homopolymeric serine and threonine residues, a putative nuclear localization signal, leucine heptad repeats, and an LXXLL motif. Putative transcriptional regulator repressing the gibberellin response and integration of phytohormone signalling. DELLAs repress cell proliferation and expansion that drives plant growth. The protein undergoes degradation in response to GA via the 26S proteasome. RGA1 binds to PIF3 and  inhibits its DNA binding activity and thus affects the expression of PIF3 regulated genes.

AT2G28290,CHR3,"Encodes a SWI2/SNF2-like protein in the SNF2 subclass. Homozygous plants with null mutations exhibit premature termination of the meristem and carpelloid structures from the inflorescence meristem. Co-activator of floral  homeotic gene expression. Acts with LFY to regulate shoot apical meristem identity. Required for meristem maintenance. Regulates  flowering under a non-inductive photoperiod. It promotes the expression of CUC2 during cotyledon boundary formation.  Affects reproductive shoot apical meristem function by regulating the expression of WUS. In CHiP experiments SYD binds to WUS promoter. Present as two forms in the nucleus, full-length and truncated, with the latter apparently lacking the C-terminal domain.

AT2G34070,TBL37,"Encodes a member of the TBL (TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE) gene family containing a plant-specific DUF231 (domain of unknown function) domain. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).",NM_001336483,817968,3702.AT2G34070.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005794, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016407, GO:0016740, GO:0016746, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",0.1766913,-0.1535553,0.7199382,0.1912506,0.7942412,0.06584828,0.09747207,-0.006152013,0.3401199,-0.4302293,1.17602,-0.3302466,0.5432469,0.01455931,0.6175499,-0.110843,-0.07921924,-0.1828433,0.1634286,-0.6069206,0.9993288,0.8734935,0.3448059,0.9477965,0.2194036,0.2510274,0.1474033,0.4936752,-0.276674,1.329575,-0.5286876,0.07430301,-0.6540899,-0.6224661,-0.7260902,-0.3798183,-1.150168,0.4560819,0.6029906,-0.1254024,-0.09377855,-0.1974026,0.1488692,-0.6214799,0.9847695,-0.7283929,-0.6967691,-0.8003932,-0.4541213,-1.224471,0.3817789,0.0316238,-0.07200029,0.2742716,-0.4960776,1.110172,-0.1036241,0.2426478,-0.5277014,1.078548,0.3462719,-0.4240773,1.182172,-0.7703492,0.8359003,1.606249,-0.1766913,0.1535553,-0.7199382,-0.1912506,-0.7942412,-0.06584828,-0.09747207,0.006152013,-0.3401199,0.4302293,-1.17602,0.3302466,-0.5432469,-0.01455931,-0.6175499,0.110843,0.07921924,0.1828433,-0.1634286,0.6069206,-0.9993288,-0.8734935,-0.3448059,-0.9477965,-0.2194036,-0.2510274,-0.1474033,-0.4936752,0.276674,-1.329575,0.5286876,-0.07430301,0.6540899,0.6224661,0.7260902,0.3798183,1.150168,-0.4560819,-0.6029906,0.1254024,0.09377855,0.1974026,-0.1488692,0.6214799,-0.9847695,0.7283929,0.6967691,0.8003932,0.4541213,1.224471,-0.3817789,-0.0316238,0.07200029,-0.2742716,0.4960776,-1.110172,0.1036241,-0.2426478,0.5277014,-1.078548,-0.3462719,0.4240773,-1.182172,0.7703492,-0.8359003,-1.606249

AT2G36910,ABCB1,"Belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Also known as AtMDR1.Possibly regulates auxin-dependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin transport in the root.  Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AT3G28860.  PGP1 mediates cellular efflux of IAA and interacts with PIN genes that may confer an accelerated vectoral component to PGP-mediated transport.

AT2G39800,ATP5CS,"encodes a delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase that catalyzes the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of proline. Gene is expressed in reproductive organs and tissues under non-stress conditions but in the whole plant under water-limiting condition. Expression is also induced by abscisic acid and salt stress in a light-dependent manner. P5CS1 appears to be involved in salt stress responses related to proline accumulation, including protection from reactive oxidative species. P5CS1 appears to be present in different cells and/or different subcellular locations from P5CS2 in a tissue-dependent manner.",NM_001202785,818566,3702.AT2G39800.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0008152, GO:0016491",0.5277203,0.3792302,0.7022187,0.1004692,1.200622,0.8389277,0.6152648,0.5540572,1.246308,0.2120635,1.010834,-0.1484901,0.1744984,-0.4272511,0.672902,0.3112074,0.08754453,0.02633696,0.7185879,-0.3156568,0.4831133,0.3229885,-0.278761,0.8213921,0.4596975,0.2360347,0.1748271,0.867078,-0.1671666,0.6316034,-0.6017495,0.4984036,0.136709,-0.08695389,-0.1481615,0.5440895,-0.4901552,0.3086148,1.100153,0.7384585,0.5147956,0.4535881,1.145839,0.1115943,0.9103644,-0.3616946,-0.5853575,-0.6465651,0.04568588,-0.9885588,-0.1897888,-0.2236628,-0.2848704,0.4073805,-0.6268641,0.1719059,-0.06120757,0.6310434,-0.4032013,0.3955687,0.6922509,-0.3419937,0.4567763,-1.034245,-0.2354746,0.79877,-0.5277203,-0.3792302,-0.7022187,-0.1004692,-1.200622,-0.8389277,-0.6152648,-0.5540572,-1.246308,-0.2120635,-1.010834,0.1484901,-0.1744984,0.4272511,-0.672902,-0.3112074,-0.08754453,-0.02633696,-0.7185879,0.3156568,-0.4831133,-0.3229885,0.278761,-0.8213921,-0.4596975,-0.2360347,-0.1748271,-0.867078,0.1671666,-0.6316034,0.6017495,-0.4984036,-0.136709,0.08695389,0.1481615,-0.5440895,0.4901552,-0.3086148,-1.100153,-0.7384585,-0.5147956,-0.4535881,-1.145839,-0.1115943,-0.9103644,0.3616946,0.5853575,0.6465651,-0.04568588,0.9885588,0.1897888,0.2236628,0.2848704,-0.4073805,0.6268641,-0.1719059,0.06120757,-0.6310434,0.4032013,-0.3955687,-0.6922509,0.3419937,-0.4567763,1.034245,0.2354746,-0.79877

AT2G46370,AtGH3.11,"Encodes a jasmonate-amido synthetase that is a member of the GH3 family of proteins. JAR1 catalyzes the formation of a biologically active jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate. JA-Ile promotes the interaction between JAZ1 and COI1 in the jasmonate signaling pathway. JAR1 localizes to the cytoplasm and is also a phytochrome A signaling component. JAR1 is an auxin-induced gene. Loss of function mutants are defective in a variety of responses to jasmonic acid. JAR1 has additional enzymatic activities in vitro, (e.g. the ability to synthesize adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate and other JA conjugates), but there are no data to show whether JAR1 catalyzes many of these reactions in vivo.

AT3G01910,AT-SO,Encodes a homodimeric Mo-enzyme with molybdopterin as organic component of the molybdenum cofactor.  It lacks the heme domain that other eukaryotic Mo-enzymes possess and has no redox-active centers other than the molybdenum.  SO protein has been found in all parts of the plant.

AT3G08730,ATPK1,"Encodes a protein-serine kinase that phosphorylates ribosomal protein in vitro. Activation of AtS6k is regulated by 1-naphthylacetic acid and kinetin, at least in part, via a lipid kinase-dependent pathway. Involved in translational up-regulation of ribosomal proteins. Phosphorylated by PDK1. Interacts with RAPTOR1, which in turn interacts with TOR. SPK6 activity is affected by osmotic stress, and plants overexpressing S6k1 are hypersensitive to osmotic stress.

AT3G16570,ATRALF23,"Encodes RALF23, a member of a diversely expressed predicted peptide family showing sequence similarity to tobacco Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF), and is believed to play an essential role in the physiology of Arabidopsis.  Consists of a single exon and is characterized by a conserved C-terminal motif and N-terminal signal peptide.  RALF23 is significantly downregulated by brassinolide treatment of seedlings.   Overexpression of AtRALF23 impairs brassinolide-induced hypocotyls elongation, and mature overexpressing plants are shorter and bushier. RALF23 overexpression produces slower growing seedlings with roots that have reduced capacity to acidify the rhizosphere.",NM_001338245,820907,3702.AT3G16570.1,"GO:0004871, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009987, GO:0019722, GO:0030054, GO:0035556, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0065007",0.04162773,-0.1393546,-0.2305412,0.3673073,-0.1401073,-0.2557275,0.02244114,0.03738595,-0.04803014,0.1447317,0.6404757,-0.1809824,-0.272169,0.3256796,-0.181735,-0.2973552,-0.01918659,-0.00424178,-0.08965787,0.1031039,0.598848,-0.0911866,0.506662,-0.000752616,-0.1163728,0.1617958,0.1767406,0.0913245,0.2840863,0.7798304,0.5978485,0.09043398,-0.02518624,0.2529824,0.2679272,0.1825111,0.3752729,0.871017,-0.5074146,-0.6230348,-0.3448662,-0.3299214,-0.4153375,-0.2225756,0.2731684,-0.1156202,0.1625484,0.1774932,0.09207711,0.2848389,0.780583,0.2781686,0.2931134,0.2076973,0.4004591,0.8962032,0.01494481,-0.07047128,0.1222905,0.6180346,-0.08541609,0.1073457,0.6030898,0.1927618,0.6885059,0.4957441,-0.04162773,0.1393546,0.2305412,-0.3673073,0.1401073,0.2557275,-0.02244114,-0.03738595,0.04803014,-0.1447317,-0.6404757,0.1809824,0.272169,-0.3256796,0.181735,0.2973552,0.01918659,0.00424178,0.08965787,-0.1031039,-0.598848,0.0911866,-0.506662,0.000752616,0.1163728,-0.1617958,-0.1767406,-0.0913245,-0.2840863,-0.7798304,-0.5978485,-0.09043398,0.02518624,-0.2529824,-0.2679272,-0.1825111,-0.3752729,-0.871017,0.5074146,0.6230348,0.3448662,0.3299214,0.4153375,0.2225756,-0.2731684,0.1156202,-0.1625484,-0.1774932,-0.09207711,-0.2848389,-0.780583,-0.2781686,-0.2931134,-0.2076973,-0.4004591,-0.8962032,-0.01494481,0.07047128,-0.1222905,-0.6180346,0.08541609,-0.1073457,-0.6030898,-0.1927618,-0.6885059,-0.4957441

AT3G42170,DAYSLEEPER,"transposase-like gene with conserved domains from the family of hAT transposases that includes hobo from Drosophila melanogaster, Activator (Ac) from maize, and Tam3 from snapdragon but lacks several amino acids known to be essential for Ac transposition5. The DAYSLEEPER gene lacks 8 bp duplications and TIRs (a common feature of transcriptionally silent hAT transposases), however, DAYSLEEPER expression was detected, and several expressed sequence tags are available. The expression seems to be under the control of factors determining the circadian rhythm.

AT3G44320,AtNIT3,This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (EC 3.5.5.1) and IAN to indole-3-acetamide (IAM) at lower levels.  It is the only one of the four Arabidopsis nitrilases whose mRNA levels are strongly induced when plants experience sulphur deprivation.

It is coregulated with TOC1 and seems to be repressed by CCA1 and LHY by direct binding of these proteins to the evening element in the LUX promoter.",NM_001035746,823817,3702.AT3G46640.3,NA,0.1296006,0.6810283,0.6854217,-0.1260108,0.2410871,0.4394157,0.4272716,0.4260279,0.2942827,0.9392493,1.078427,0.5514277,0.5558211,-0.2556114,0.1114865,0.3098151,0.297671,0.2964273,0.1646821,0.8096487,0.9488265,0.004393405,-0.8070391,-0.4399412,-0.2416126,-0.2537567,-0.2550004,-0.3867456,0.258221,0.3973988,-0.8114325,-0.4443346,-0.246006,-0.2581501,-0.2593938,-0.391139,0.2538276,0.3930054,0.3670979,0.5654265,0.5532824,0.5520387,0.4202935,1.06526,1.204438,0.1983286,0.1861845,0.1849408,0.05319559,0.6981622,0.83734,-0.01214414,-0.01338782,-0.145133,0.4998336,0.6390114,-0.001243682,-0.1329889,0.5119777,0.6511555,-0.1317452,0.5132214,0.6523992,0.6449666,0.7841444,0.1391778,-0.1296006,-0.6810283,-0.6854217,0.1260108,-0.2410871,-0.4394157,-0.4272716,-0.4260279,-0.2942827,-0.9392493,-1.078427,-0.5514277,-0.5558211,0.2556114,-0.1114865,-0.3098151,-0.297671,-0.2964273,-0.1646821,-0.8096487,-0.9488265,-0.004393405,0.8070391,0.4399412,0.2416126,0.2537567,0.2550004,0.3867456,-0.258221,-0.3973988,0.8114325,0.4443346,0.246006,0.2581501,0.2593938,0.391139,-0.2538276,-0.3930054,-0.3670979,-0.5654265,-0.5532824,-0.5520387,-0.4202935,-1.06526,-1.204438,-0.1983286,-0.1861845,-0.1849408,-0.05319559,-0.6981622,-0.83734,0.01214414,0.01338782,0.145133,-0.4998336,-0.6390114,0.001243682,0.1329889,-0.5119777,-0.6511555,0.1317452,-0.5132214,-0.6523992,-0.6449666,-0.7841444,-0.1391778

AT3G51840,ACX4,"Encodes a short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, which catalyzes the first step of peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation during early, post-germinative growth in oilseed species. Null mutants virtually lack short-chain acyl-CoA and are resistant to 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid, which is converted to the herbicide and auxin analogue 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by beta-oxidation.

AT4G03560,ATCCH1,Encodes a depolarization-activated Ca(2+) channel. Anti-sense experiments with this gene as well as Sucrose-H(+) symporters and complementation of yeast sucrose uptake mutant cch1 suggest that this protein mediates a voltage-activated Ca(2+ )influx.

AT4G13350,NIG,"Encodes a GTPase that interacts with nuclear shuttle proteins (NSPs) from a number of different plant viruses. The gene is widely expressed and NIG transcript levels do not rise in response to viral infection. This cytoplasmic protein does not directly interact with a viral movement protein (MP), but, it does promote the movement of NSP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

AT4G26970,ACO2,"Encodes an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of citrate to isocitrate through a cis-aconitate intermediate, indicating that it may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways.

AT4G32830,AtAUR1,"Encodes a member of a family of Ser/Thr kinases whose activities peak during cell division.  Transcripts are abundant in tissues rich in dividing cells like roots and flowers but are low or absent in fully expanded leaves and stems.  In interphase cells, the protein is predominantly nuclear.  During mitosis, the protein associates with plant-specific cytoskeletal structures (preprophase band, phragmoplast, nascent cell plate) that are necessary for cytokinesis as well as with the microtubule spindle. It specifically phosphorylates Ser10 of histone H3 and colocalizes with phosphorylated histone H3 during mitosis.",NM_119436,829419,NA,"GO:0000228, GO:0000910, GO:0003824, GO:0004672, GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0005694, GO:0005815, GO:0005856, GO:0005874, GO:0006325, GO:0006464, GO:0006468, GO:0006796, GO:0006996, GO:0007010, GO:0007049, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016043, GO:0016301, GO:0016740, GO:0019538, GO:0032991, GO:0043226, GO:0043234, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0051726, GO:0065007, GO:0071840",-0.4049105,-0.5410733,-0.8389533,-0.1185279,-0.04485316,-0.1246437,-0.1974457,-0.7680961,-0.8979688,-0.6778274,-0.6236559,-0.1361628,-0.4340428,0.2863826,0.3600573,0.2802667,0.2074647,-0.3631857,-0.4930583,-0.2729169,-0.2187455,-0.29788,0.4225454,0.4962201,0.4164295,0.3436275,-0.2270229,-0.3568955,-0.1367541,-0.08258266,0.7204254,0.7941001,0.7143095,0.6415076,0.07085715,-0.05901549,0.1611259,0.2152974,0.07367473,-0.00611585,-0.07891783,-0.6495682,-0.7794409,-0.5592995,-0.505128,-0.07979058,-0.1525926,-0.723243,-0.8531156,-0.6329742,-0.5788028,-0.07280198,-0.6434524,-0.773325,-0.5531837,-0.4990122,-0.5706504,-0.7005231,-0.4803817,-0.4262102,-0.1298726,0.09026873,0.1444402,0.2201414,0.2743129,0.05417148,0.4049105,0.5410733,0.8389533,0.1185279,0.04485316,0.1246437,0.1974457,0.7680961,0.8979688,0.6778274,0.6236559,0.1361628,0.4340428,-0.2863826,-0.3600573,-0.2802667,-0.2074647,0.3631857,0.4930583,0.2729169,0.2187455,0.29788,-0.4225454,-0.4962201,-0.4164295,-0.3436275,0.2270229,0.3568955,0.1367541,0.08258266,-0.7204254,-0.7941001,-0.7143095,-0.6415076,-0.07085715,0.05901549,-0.1611259,-0.2152974,-0.07367473,0.00611585,0.07891783,0.6495682,0.7794409,0.5592995,0.505128,0.07979058,0.1525926,0.723243,0.8531156,0.6329742,0.5788028,0.07280198,0.6434524,0.773325,0.5531837,0.4990122,0.5706504,0.7005231,0.4803817,0.4262102,0.1298726,-0.09026873,-0.1444402,-0.2201414,-0.2743129,-0.05417148

AT4G34460,AGB1,"Encodes the heterotrimeric G-protein beta subunit and is involved in organ shape. A significant fraction of the protein is found in the ER.  Mutants carrying null alleles express similar fruit phenotypes, as seen in er plants, but differ from er in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the pedicel is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are rounder than those in er mutants. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level found in siliques. It is involved in resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The predicted protein has two DWD motifs.

AT5G02100,ORP3A,Encodes a protein that binds to beta-sitosterol and localizes to the ER. The WFDE motif in ORP3a appears to be important for a direct interaction with PVA12 [Plant VAMP-Associated protein 12]. Mutation of this motif causes ORP3a to relocalize to the Golgi and cytosol. The interaction between PVA12 and ORP3a does not appear to be sterol-dependent.,NM_001342644,831841,3702.AT5G02100.1,NA,-0.0806409,-0.1922062,0.3528401,-0.3818861,0.1418165,0.2000533,0.04393489,0.8456465,0.8157507,0.7425056,0.7852767,-0.1115653,0.433481,-0.3012452,0.2224574,0.2806942,0.1245758,0.9262874,0.8963916,0.8231465,0.8659176,0.5450462,-0.18968,0.3340226,0.3922595,0.236141,1.037853,1.007957,0.9347117,0.9774829,-0.7347262,-0.2110236,-0.1527868,-0.3089052,0.4928064,0.4629106,0.3896655,0.4324367,0.5237026,0.5819394,0.425821,1.227533,1.197637,1.124392,1.167163,0.05823681,-0.0978816,0.70383,0.6739342,0.6006891,0.6434602,-0.1561184,0.6455932,0.6156974,0.5424523,0.5852234,0.8017116,0.7718158,0.6985707,0.7413418,-0.02989576,-0.1031409,-0.06036974,-0.07324512,-0.03047398,0.04277113,0.0806409,0.1922062,-0.3528401,0.3818861,-0.1418165,-0.2000533,-0.04393489,-0.8456465,-0.8157507,-0.7425056,-0.7852767,0.1115653,-0.433481,0.3012452,-0.2224574,-0.2806942,-0.1245758,-0.9262874,-0.8963916,-0.8231465,-0.8659176,-0.5450462,0.18968,-0.3340226,-0.3922595,-0.236141,-1.037853,-1.007957,-0.9347117,-0.9774829,0.7347262,0.2110236,0.1527868,0.3089052,-0.4928064,-0.4629106,-0.3896655,-0.4324367,-0.5237026,-0.5819394,-0.425821,-1.227533,-1.197637,-1.124392,-1.167163,-0.05823681,0.0978816,-0.70383,-0.6739342,-0.6006891,-0.6434602,0.1561184,-0.6455932,-0.6156974,-0.5424523,-0.5852234,-0.8017116,-0.7718158,-0.6985707,-0.7413418,0.02989576,0.1031409,0.06036974,0.07324512,0.03047398,-0.04277113

AT5G06700,TBR,"Encodes a member of the TBL (TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE) gene family containing a plant-specific DUF231 (domain of unknown function) domain. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication). A tbr mutant is impaired in its ability to deposit secondary wall cellulose in specific cell types, most notably in trichomes.",NM_120753,830559,3702.AT5G06700.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005794, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016407, GO:0016740, GO:0016746, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",0.07406818,0.0122778,0.09826494,0.2961452,-0.02240689,0.07886329,-0.0211827,0.09041496,0.01761554,0.1082269,-0.06736225,-0.06179038,0.02419676,0.222077,-0.09647507,0.004795107,-0.09525088,0.01634678,-0.05645264,0.0341587,-0.1414304,0.08598714,0.2838674,-0.03468469,0.06658549,-0.0334605,0.07813716,0.005337737,0.09594908,-0.07964005,0.1978803,-0.1206718,-0.01940165,-0.1194476,-0.007849977,-0.0806494,0.009961938,-0.1656272,-0.3185521,-0.2172819,-0.3173279,-0.2057302,-0.2785297,-0.1879183,-0.3635075,0.1012702,0.001224191,0.1128219,0.04002242,0.1306338,-0.04495536,-0.100046,0.01155168,-0.06124775,0.02936359,-0.1462255,0.1115977,0.03879823,0.1294096,-0.04617955,-0.07279943,0.01781191,-0.1577772,0.09061134,-0.08497778,-0.1755891,-0.07406818,-0.0122778,-0.09826494,-0.2961452,0.02240689,-0.07886329,0.0211827,-0.09041496,-0.01761554,-0.1082269,0.06736225,0.06179038,-0.02419676,-0.222077,0.09647507,-0.004795107,0.09525088,-0.01634678,0.05645264,-0.0341587,0.1414304,-0.08598714,-0.2838674,0.03468469,-0.06658549,0.0334605,-0.07813716,-0.005337737,-0.09594908,0.07964005,-0.1978803,0.1206718,0.01940165,0.1194476,0.007849977,0.0806494,-0.009961938,0.1656272,0.3185521,0.2172819,0.3173279,0.2057302,0.2785297,0.1879183,0.3635075,-0.1012702,-0.001224191,-0.1128219,-0.04002242,-0.1306338,0.04495536,0.100046,-0.01155168,0.06124775,-0.02936359,0.1462255,-0.1115977,-0.03879823,-0.1294096,0.04617955,0.07279943,-0.01781191,0.1577772,-0.09061134,0.08497778,0.1755891

AT5G22000,RHF2A,encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in gametogenesis. Double mutant analyses with RHF1a suggests that RHF2a may be involved in targetting ICK4KRP6 for degradation following meiosis in order to allow the mitoses associated with megagametogenesis and microgametogenesis to occur. RHF2a is expressed in all four floral whorls and is present at ~8-fold higher levels than RHF1a in inflorescences by RT-PCR analyses.,NM_001343714,832260,3702.AT5G22000.1,NA,0.295803,0.08106124,0.3584165,-0.3418938,-0.005894816,-0.317245,0.4872914,0.5733692,0.6408603,0.4054038,1.345299,-0.2147417,0.06261357,-0.6376968,-0.3016978,-0.6130479,0.1914885,0.2775662,0.3450574,0.1096009,1.049496,0.2773553,-0.422955,-0.08695605,-0.3983062,0.4062302,0.4923079,0.5597991,0.3243426,1.264238,-0.7003103,-0.3643113,-0.6756615,0.1288749,0.2149526,0.2824438,0.04698729,0.9868823,0.335999,0.02464882,0.8291852,0.915263,0.9827541,0.7472976,1.687193,-0.3113502,0.4931862,0.579264,0.6467551,0.4112986,1.351194,0.8045364,0.8906141,0.9581053,0.7226488,1.662544,0.08607775,0.1535689,-0.0818876,0.8580074,0.06749115,-0.1679653,0.7719297,-0.2354565,0.7044385,0.939895,-0.295803,-0.08106124,-0.3584165,0.3418938,0.005894816,0.317245,-0.4872914,-0.5733692,-0.6408603,-0.4054038,-1.345299,0.2147417,-0.06261357,0.6376968,0.3016978,0.6130479,-0.1914885,-0.2775662,-0.3450574,-0.1096009,-1.049496,-0.2773553,0.422955,0.08695605,0.3983062,-0.4062302,-0.4923079,-0.5597991,-0.3243426,-1.264238,0.7003103,0.3643113,0.6756615,-0.1288749,-0.2149526,-0.2824438,-0.04698729,-0.9868823,-0.335999,-0.02464882,-0.8291852,-0.915263,-0.9827541,-0.7472976,-1.687193,0.3113502,-0.4931862,-0.579264,-0.6467551,-0.4112986,-1.351194,-0.8045364,-0.8906141,-0.9581053,-0.7226488,-1.662544,-0.08607775,-0.1535689,0.0818876,-0.8580074,-0.06749115,0.1679653,-0.7719297,0.2354565,-0.7044385,-0.939895

AT5G44610,MAP18,"Encodes a protein with seven repeated VEEKK motifs. RNAi and overexpression experiments suggest that the gene is not involved in cell division but might be consequential for cell shape of epidermal and cortical cells. The protein encoded by this gene binds to cortical microtubules and inhibits tubulin polymerization.

AT5G46210,ATCUL4,Arabidopsis CULLIN4 (CUL4) forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase with the CDD complex and a common catalytic subunit RBX1 in mediating light control of development.  This CUL4-based E3 ligase is essential for the repression of photomorphogenesis.

AT5G46860,ATSYP22,"Syntaxin-related protein required for vacuolar assembly. A member of t-SNARE superfamily, homologous to yest Vam3p. Localized in the vacuolar membranes. The protein has a heptad repeat structure (residues164220) in which hydrophobic amino acid residues appear at seven amino acid intervals. Such regions have a high potential to form an amphiphilic a-helix, intriguing for the intermolecular interactions by forming coiled-coil structure. AtVam3p has a highly hydrophobic segment at its C terminus thus implicating it to be a membrane protein while the rest of the sequence is hydrophilic.",NM_124057,834730,3702.AT5G46860.1,"GO:0005484, GO:0005488, GO:0005515, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006996, GO:0008104, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0016020, GO:0016021, GO:0016043, GO:0016192, GO:0031201, GO:0032991, GO:0043234, GO:0044464, GO:0051179, GO:0071840",0.1759107,-0.1388098,0.3423893,-0.03242973,0.03466241,0.2030128,0.1354807,-0.0632049,0.1848995,0.0936918,0.2433851,-0.3147204,0.1664787,-0.2083404,-0.1412483,0.02710214,-0.04042995,-0.2391156,0.008988865,-0.08221888,0.0674744,0.4811991,0.10638,0.1734722,0.3418226,0.2742905,0.07560488,0.3237093,0.2325016,0.3821948,-0.3748191,-0.3077269,-0.1393765,-0.2069086,-0.4055942,-0.1574898,-0.2486975,-0.09900426,0.06709214,0.2354425,0.1679105,-0.03077517,0.2173293,0.1261215,0.2758148,0.1683504,0.1008183,-0.0978673,0.1502371,0.05902939,0.2087227,-0.06753209,-0.2662177,-0.01811328,-0.109321,0.04037226,-0.1986856,0.04941881,-0.04178893,0.1079043,0.2481044,0.1568967,0.30659,-0.09120774,0.05848553,0.1496933,-0.1759107,0.1388098,-0.3423893,0.03242973,-0.03466241,-0.2030128,-0.1354807,0.0632049,-0.1848995,-0.0936918,-0.2433851,0.3147204,-0.1664787,0.2083404,0.1412483,-0.02710214,0.04042995,0.2391156,-0.008988865,0.08221888,-0.0674744,-0.4811991,-0.10638,-0.1734722,-0.3418226,-0.2742905,-0.07560488,-0.3237093,-0.2325016,-0.3821948,0.3748191,0.3077269,0.1393765,0.2069086,0.4055942,0.1574898,0.2486975,0.09900426,-0.06709214,-0.2354425,-0.1679105,0.03077517,-0.2173293,-0.1261215,-0.2758148,-0.1683504,-0.1008183,0.0978673,-0.1502371,-0.05902939,-0.2087227,0.06753209,0.2662177,0.01811328,0.109321,-0.04037226,0.1986856,-0.04941881,0.04178893,-0.1079043,-0.2481044,-0.1568967,-0.30659,0.09120774,-0.05848553,-0.1496933

AT5G57090,AGR,"Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors.

AT5G58220,ALNS,"Encodes a transthyretin-like S-allantoin synthase protein that catalyzes two steps in the allantoin biosynthesis pathway by acting as a hydroxyisourate hydrolase and a 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) decarboxylase. Two alternatively spliced versions of the transcript give rise to a longer peroxisomally-targeted protein (AT5G58220.1  (called TTL1-)) and a slightly shorter cytoplasmic protein (AT5G58220.3 (called TTL2-)). Both have roughly equivalent enzymatic activity in vitro, but, allantoin biosynthesis is believed to occur in the peroxisome suggesting that the cytosolic form may participate in a different process.",NM_001037016,835934,3702.AT5G58220.1,,-0.11899,-0.09795691,0.1630935,-0.262905,-0.1835041,-0.00695203,0.2840194,-0.2221319,0.2890821,0.08697686,0.6335451,0.02103307,0.2820834,-0.143915,-0.06451411,0.112038,0.4030094,-0.1031419,0.408072,0.2059668,0.7525351,0.2610504,-0.164948,-0.08554718,0.09100488,0.3819763,-0.124175,0.387039,0.1849338,0.731502,-0.4259984,-0.3465975,-0.1700455,0.1209259,-0.3852254,0.1259886,-0.07611659,0.4704517,0.07940086,0.2559529,0.5469243,0.04077303,0.551987,0.3498818,0.8964501,0.1765521,0.4675235,-0.03862783,0.4725861,0.2704809,0.8170492,0.2909714,-0.2151799,0.2960341,0.09392889,0.6404972,-0.5061513,0.005062662,-0.1970425,0.3495257,0.511214,0.3091088,0.8556771,-0.2021052,0.3444631,0.5465683,0.11899,0.09795691,-0.1630935,0.262905,0.1835041,0.00695203,-0.2840194,0.2221319,-0.2890821,-0.08697686,-0.6335451,-0.02103307,-0.2820834,0.143915,0.06451411,-0.112038,-0.4030094,0.1031419,-0.408072,-0.2059668,-0.7525351,-0.2610504,0.164948,0.08554718,-0.09100488,-0.3819763,0.124175,-0.387039,-0.1849338,-0.731502,0.4259984,0.3465975,0.1700455,-0.1209259,0.3852254,-0.1259886,0.07611659,-0.4704517,-0.07940086,-0.2559529,-0.5469243,-0.04077303,-0.551987,-0.3498818,-0.8964501,-0.1765521,-0.4675235,0.03862783,-0.4725861,-0.2704809,-0.8170492,-0.2909714,0.2151799,-0.2960341,-0.09392889,-0.6404972,0.5061513,-0.005062662,0.1970425,-0.3495257,-0.511214,-0.3091088,-0.8556771,0.2021052,-0.3444631,-0.5465683
AT5G58230,ATMSI1,"Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA.

AT5G62440,NA,Encodes a protein DOMINO1 that belongs to a plant-specific gene family sharing a common motif present in the tomato DEFECTIVE CHLOROPLASTS AND LEAVES (LeDCL) protein.  DOMINO1 is located in the nucleus.  Arabidopsis embryos carrying the domino1 mutation grow slowly in comparison with wild type embryos and reach only the globular stage at desiccation. The primary defect of the mutation at the cellular level is the large size of the nucleolus that can be observed soon after fertilization in the nuclei of both the embryo and the endosperm.

AT5G65970,ATMLO10,"A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO10 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO5, AtMLO7, AtMLO8, and AtMLO9. The gene is expressed in root and cotyledon vascular system, in root-shoot junction and lateral root primordia and in developing siliques, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s",NM_001345729,836727,3702.AT5G65970.1,"GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",0.8434368,-0.1998006,0.3106346,0.1217206,2.846873,-0.8501261,0.9357164,0.3198906,0.9144901,-0.2180887,1.10716,-1.043237,-0.5328022,-0.7217162,2.003436,-1.693563,0.09227963,-0.5235462,0.07105332,-1.061526,0.2637234,0.5104352,0.3215211,3.046673,-0.6503255,1.135517,0.5196911,1.114291,-0.01828818,1.306961,-0.188914,2.536238,-1.160761,0.6250818,0.009255922,0.6038555,-0.5287234,0.7965255,2.725152,-0.9718467,0.8139958,0.19817,0.7927695,-0.3398093,0.9854396,-3.696999,-1.911156,-2.526982,-1.932383,-3.064962,-1.739713,1.785842,1.170017,1.764616,0.6320373,1.957286,-0.6158259,-0.02122631,-1.153805,0.1714437,0.5945996,-0.5379793,0.7872696,-1.132579,0.19267,1.325249,-0.8434368,0.1998006,-0.3106346,-0.1217206,-2.846873,0.8501261,-0.9357164,-0.3198906,-0.9144901,0.2180887,-1.10716,1.043237,0.5328022,0.7217162,-2.003436,1.693563,-0.09227963,0.5235462,-0.07105332,1.061526,-0.2637234,-0.5104352,-0.3215211,-3.046673,0.6503255,-1.135517,-0.5196911,-1.114291,0.01828818,-1.306961,0.188914,-2.536238,1.160761,-0.6250818,-0.009255922,-0.6038555,0.5287234,-0.7965255,-2.725152,0.9718467,-0.8139958,-0.19817,-0.7927695,0.3398093,-0.9854396,3.696999,1.911156,2.526982,1.932383,3.064962,1.739713,-1.785842,-1.170017,-1.764616,-0.6320373,-1.957286,0.6158259,0.02122631,1.153805,-0.1714437,-0.5945996,0.5379793,-0.7872696,1.132579,-0.19267,-1.325249
