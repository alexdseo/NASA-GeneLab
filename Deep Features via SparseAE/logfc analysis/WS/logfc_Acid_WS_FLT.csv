"25","AT1G04250","AXR3","Transcription regulator acting as repressor of auxin-inducible gene expression. Auxin-inducible AUX/IAA gene. Short-lived nuclear protein with four conserved domains. Domain III has homology to beta alpha alpha dimerization and DNA binding domains. Involved in auxin signaling. Auxin induces the degradation of the protein in a dosage-dependent manner in a process mediated by AtRac1. Auxin induced the relocalization of the protein within the nucleus from a diffused nucleoplasmic pattern to a discrete particulated pattern named nuclear protein bodies or NPB in a process also mediated by Rac1.

Expression of both ACLA and ACLB but not of either of the subunits alone results in ACL activity.","NM_100814",837466,"3702.AT1G09430.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005975, GO:0006091, GO:0006099, GO:0006629, GO:0006732, GO:0008152, GO:0016740, GO:0016829, GO:0016874, GO:0044238",0.071722894,0.117961024,0.617453004,-0.298758995,0.091623126,-0.099189472,0.220238008,0.208174572,0.967348545,0.30815708,0.950376007,0.04623813,0.545730109,-0.370481889,0.019900232,-0.170912366,0.148515114,0.136451678,0.89562565,0.236434185,0.878653113,0.49949198,-0.416720019,-0.026337898,-0.217150496,0.102276984,0.090213548,0.84938752,0.190196056,0.832414983,-0.916211999,-0.525829877,-0.716642475,-0.397214996,-0.409278431,0.349895541,-0.309295924,0.332923004,0.390382121,0.199569523,0.518997003,0.506933567,1.266107539,0.606916075,1.249135002,-0.190812598,0.128614882,0.116551446,0.875725418,0.216533953,0.858752881,0.31942748,0.307364044,1.066538016,0.407346551,1.049565479,-0.012063436,0.747110537,0.087919072,0.730137999,0.759173972,0.099982507,0.742201435,-0.659191465,-0.016972537,0.642218927,-0.071722894,-0.117961024,-0.617453004,0.298758995,-0.091623126,0.099189472,-0.220238008,-0.208174572,-0.967348545,-0.30815708,-0.950376007,-0.04623813,-0.545730109,0.370481889,-0.019900232,0.170912366,-0.148515114,-0.136451678,-0.89562565,-0.236434185,-0.878653113,-0.49949198,0.416720019,0.026337898,0.217150496,-0.102276984,-0.090213548,-0.84938752,-0.190196056,-0.832414983,0.916211999,0.525829877,0.716642475,0.397214996,0.409278431,-0.349895541,0.309295924,-0.332923004,-0.390382121,-0.199569523,-0.518997003,-0.506933567,-1.266107539,-0.606916075,-1.249135002,0.190812598,-0.128614882,-0.116551446,-0.875725418,-0.216533953,-0.858752881,-0.31942748,-0.307364044,-1.066538016,-0.407346551,-1.049565479,0.012063436,-0.747110537,-0.087919072,-0.730137999,-0.759173972,-0.099982507,-0.742201435,0.659191465,0.016972537,-0.642218927

"144","AT1G18450","ARP4","Encodes a gene similar to actin-related proteins in other organisms. Member of nuclear ARP family of genes. Component  of chromatin remodeling complexes, involved in chromatin-mediated gene regulation.  Phenotype of the arp4-1 mutant allele revealed partial sterility due to defects in anther development. Targeting the distinct, 3' UTR of AtARP4 transcripts with RNA interference caused a drastic reduction in the level of AtARP4 protein expression, and resulted in strong pleiotropic phenotypes such as altered organization of plant organs, early flowering, delayed flower senescence and high levels of sterility. Western blot analysis and immunolabelling demonstrated a clear correlation between reductions in the level of AtARP4 expression and severity of the phenotypes.","NM_101702",838425,"3702.AT1G18450.1",NA,0.132122144,0.052416577,-0.1040249,0.149220448,-0.079249047,0.079350881,0.250548615,-0.013411305,-0.054647185,-0.120009676,-0.312831997,-0.079705567,-0.236147044,0.017098304,-0.211371191,-0.052771263,0.118426471,-0.145533449,-0.186769329,-0.25213182,-0.444954141,-0.156441477,0.096803871,-0.131665624,0.026934304,0.198132038,-0.065827882,-0.107063762,-0.172426253,-0.365248574,0.253245348,0.024775853,0.183375781,0.354573515,0.090613595,0.049377715,-0.015984776,-0.208807097,-0.228469495,-0.069869567,0.101328167,-0.162631753,-0.203867633,-0.269230124,-0.462052445,0.158599928,0.329797662,0.065837743,0.024601862,-0.040760629,-0.23358295,0.171197734,-0.092762186,-0.133998066,-0.199360557,-0.392182878,-0.26395992,-0.3051958,-0.370558291,-0.563380612,-0.04123588,-0.106598371,-0.299420693,-0.065362491,-0.258184813,-0.192822321,-0.132122144,-0.052416577,0.1040249,-0.149220448,0.079249047,-0.079350881,-0.250548615,0.013411305,0.054647185,0.120009676,0.312831997,0.079705567,0.236147044,-0.017098304,0.211371191,0.052771263,-0.118426471,0.145533449,0.186769329,0.25213182,0.444954141,0.156441477,-0.096803871,0.131665624,-0.026934304,-0.198132038,0.065827882,0.107063762,0.172426253,0.365248574,-0.253245348,-0.024775853,-0.183375781,-0.354573515,-0.090613595,-0.049377715,0.015984776,0.208807097,0.228469495,0.069869567,-0.101328167,0.162631753,0.203867633,0.269230124,0.462052445,-0.158599928,-0.329797662,-0.065837743,-0.024601862,0.040760629,0.23358295,-0.171197734,0.092762186,0.133998066,0.199360557,0.392182878,0.26395992,0.3051958,0.370558291,0.563380612,0.04123588,0.106598371,0.299420693,0.065362491,0.258184813,0.192822321

"151","AT1G19350","BES1","Encodes brassinosteroid (BR) signalling protein that accumulates in the nucleus as dephosphorylated form in response to BRs. Is phosphorylated by the BIN2 GSK3 kinase. It synergistically interacts with BIM1 to bind to E box sequences (CANNTG). The protein contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), followed by a highly conserved amino-terminal domain (N) shared by all family members, a BIN2 phosphorylation domain (P), a PEST motif, involved in protein degradation in the absence of BR, and a carboxyl-terminal domain. BES1 can interact with the ELF6 and REF6 Jumonji N/C-domain containing proteins and may direct them to modify histone methylation upstream of some brassinosteroid responsive-genes","NM_001084093",838518,"3702.AT1G19350.3",NA,0.13222252,0.107955789,0.083633792,0.249799359,0.146720804,0.23516931,0.215799143,0.243207044,0.259506978,0.163470342,0.347648279,-0.024266731,-0.048588728,0.117576838,0.014498284,0.10294679,0.083576623,0.110984524,0.127284457,0.031247821,0.215425759,-0.024321997,0.14184357,0.038765015,0.127213521,0.107843354,0.135251255,0.151551189,0.055514553,0.23969249,0.166165566,0.063087012,0.151535518,0.132165351,0.159573252,0.175873185,0.079836549,0.264014487,-0.103078555,-0.014630049,-0.034000216,-0.006592314,0.009707619,-0.086329017,0.09784892,0.088448506,0.069078339,0.09648624,0.112786174,0.016749538,0.200927475,-0.019370167,0.008037734,0.024337668,-0.071698969,0.112478969,0.027407901,0.043707835,-0.052328802,0.131849136,0.016299933,-0.079736703,0.104441235,-0.096036636,0.088141301,0.184177937,-0.13222252,-0.107955789,-0.083633792,-0.249799359,-0.146720804,-0.23516931,-0.215799143,-0.243207044,-0.259506978,-0.163470342,-0.347648279,0.024266731,0.048588728,-0.117576838,-0.014498284,-0.10294679,-0.083576623,-0.110984524,-0.127284457,-0.031247821,-0.215425759,0.024321997,-0.14184357,-0.038765015,-0.127213521,-0.107843354,-0.135251255,-0.151551189,-0.055514553,-0.23969249,-0.166165566,-0.063087012,-0.151535518,-0.132165351,-0.159573252,-0.175873185,-0.079836549,-0.264014487,0.103078555,0.014630049,0.034000216,0.006592314,-0.009707619,0.086329017,-0.09784892,-0.088448506,-0.069078339,-0.09648624,-0.112786174,-0.016749538,-0.200927475,0.019370167,-0.008037734,-0.024337668,0.071698969,-0.112478969,-0.027407901,-0.043707835,0.052328802,-0.131849136,-0.016299933,0.079736703,-0.104441235,0.096036636,-0.088141301,-0.184177937

Whereas pgm2 and pgm3 single mutants are undistinguishable from the wild type, loss of both PGM2 and PGM3 severely impairs male and female gametophyte development.","NM_102167",838927,"3702.AT1G23190.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005829, GO:0005975, GO:0005976, GO:0005977, GO:0005996, GO:0006091, GO:0008152, GO:0009056, GO:0009058, GO:0009987, GO:0016853, GO:0016866, GO:0044238, GO:0044464",0.3274523,0.383060952,0.529302445,0.439326402,0.687420512,0.548701319,0.192951333,0.227710454,0.253383802,0.385668189,0.448433202,0.055608652,0.201850145,0.111874102,0.359968212,0.221249019,-0.134500967,-0.099741845,-0.074068498,0.058215889,0.120980902,0.146241492,0.05626545,0.30435956,0.165640367,-0.190109619,-0.155350498,-0.12967715,0.002607237,0.065372249,-0.089976043,0.158118068,0.019398874,-0.336351112,-0.30159199,-0.275918642,-0.143634256,-0.080869243,0.24809411,0.109374917,-0.246375069,-0.211615948,-0.1859426,-0.053658213,0.009106799,-0.138719193,-0.494469179,-0.459710058,-0.43403671,-0.301752323,-0.238987311,-0.355749986,-0.320990864,-0.295317517,-0.16303313,-0.100268117,0.034759122,0.060432469,0.192716856,0.255481869,0.025673348,0.157957734,0.220722747,0.132284387,0.195049399,0.062765013,-0.3274523,-0.383060952,-0.529302445,-0.439326402,-0.687420512,-0.548701319,-0.192951333,-0.227710454,-0.253383802,-0.385668189,-0.448433202,-0.055608652,-0.201850145,-0.111874102,-0.359968212,-0.221249019,0.134500967,0.099741845,0.074068498,-0.058215889,-0.120980902,-0.146241492,-0.05626545,-0.30435956,-0.165640367,0.190109619,0.155350498,0.12967715,-0.002607237,-0.065372249,0.089976043,-0.158118068,-0.019398874,0.336351112,0.30159199,0.275918642,0.143634256,0.080869243,-0.24809411,-0.109374917,0.246375069,0.211615948,0.1859426,0.053658213,-0.009106799,0.138719193,0.494469179,0.459710058,0.43403671,0.301752323,0.238987311,0.355749986,0.320990864,0.295317517,0.16303313,0.100268117,-0.034759122,-0.060432469,-0.192716856,-0.255481869,-0.025673348,-0.157957734,-0.220722747,-0.132284387,-0.195049399,-0.062765013

"213","AT1G27650","ATU2AF35A","U2 auxiliary factor small subunit. The atU2AF35a protein and its homolog, atU2AF35b, contain most of the conserved domains of hsU2AF35, including the psiRRM, one RS domain, two zinc fingers, and the two regions for interacting with U2AF large subunit. Both proteins lack the stretch of glycines present in human U2AF35. The sequences are overall 83% identical, and each Arabidopsis homolog shows approximately 70% similarity to hsU2AF35.    U2AF(35) homologs were also identified from maize, rice and other plants with large-scale EST projects. Both genes are expressed in all major tissues, with atU2AF(35)a expressed at a higher level than atU2AF(35)b in most tissues. The expression patterns were different in roots: atU2AF(35)b expressed strongly in whole young roots and root tips and atU2AF(35)a limited to root vascular regions.","NM_001084140",839657,"3702.AT1G27650.1","GO:0000398, GO:0003676, GO:0003723, GO:0005488, GO:0006139, GO:0006397, GO:0008152, GO:0016070, GO:0030529, GO:0044238, GO:0032991",-0.00428086,0.216210719,-0.140676046,0.017991281,-0.422135823,-0.198696478,0.341358018,0.024841393,0.08108997,0.298665128,0.417773494,0.22049158,-0.136395185,0.022272142,-0.417854962,-0.194415618,0.345638879,0.029122253,0.08537083,0.302945989,0.422054354,-0.356886765,-0.198219438,-0.638346542,-0.414907197,0.125147299,-0.191369326,-0.135120749,0.082454409,0.201562775,0.158667327,-0.281459777,-0.058020432,0.482034064,0.165517438,0.221766015,0.439341174,0.55844954,-0.440127104,-0.216687759,0.323366737,0.006850111,0.063098688,0.280673847,0.399782213,0.223439345,0.763493841,0.446977215,0.503225792,0.720800951,0.839909317,0.540054496,0.223537871,0.279786448,0.497361606,0.616469972,-0.316516626,-0.260268049,-0.04269289,0.076415476,0.056248577,0.273823736,0.392932101,0.217575159,0.336683524,0.119108366,0.00428086,-0.216210719,0.140676046,-0.017991281,0.422135823,0.198696478,-0.341358018,-0.024841393,-0.08108997,-0.298665128,-0.417773494,-0.22049158,0.136395185,-0.022272142,0.417854962,0.194415618,-0.345638879,-0.029122253,-0.08537083,-0.302945989,-0.422054354,0.356886765,0.198219438,0.638346542,0.414907197,-0.125147299,0.191369326,0.135120749,-0.082454409,-0.201562775,-0.158667327,0.281459777,0.058020432,-0.482034064,-0.165517438,-0.221766015,-0.439341174,-0.55844954,0.440127104,0.216687759,-0.323366737,-0.006850111,-0.063098688,-0.280673847,-0.399782213,-0.223439345,-0.763493841,-0.446977215,-0.503225792,-0.720800951,-0.839909317,-0.540054496,-0.223537871,-0.279786448,-0.497361606,-0.616469972,0.316516626,0.260268049,0.04269289,-0.076415476,-0.056248577,-0.273823736,-0.392932101,-0.217575159,-0.336683524,-0.119108366

"257","AT1G35720","ANN1","Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion.","NM_103274",840476,"3702.AT1G35720.1","GO:0006631, GO:0006629, GO:0008152, GO:0044238",0.5848507,-0.4694737,2.205541,0.9400155,0.9985573,0.70529,0.8627149,0.6957037,2.235126,1.425816,2.980782,-1.054324,1.62069,0.3551647,0.4137065,0.1204392,0.2778642,0.1108529,1.650275,0.8409651,2.395932,2.675014,1.409489,1.468031,1.174764,1.332189,1.165177,2.704599,1.89529,3.450256,-1.265525,-1.206983,-1.500251,-1.342826,-1.509837,0.02958501,-0.7797248,0.7752418,0.0585418,-0.2347255,-0.07730056,-0.2443118,1.29511,0.4858004,2.040767,-0.2932673,-0.1358424,-0.3028536,1.236568,0.4272586,1.982225,0.1574249,-0.009586296,1.529836,0.7205259,2.275493,-0.1670112,1.372411,0.5631009,2.118068,1.539422,0.7301122,2.285079,-0.8093098,0.7456568,1.554967,-0.5848507,0.4694737,-2.205541,-0.9400155,-0.9985573,-0.70529,-0.8627149,-0.6957037,-2.235126,-1.425816,-2.980782,1.054324,-1.62069,-0.3551647,-0.4137065,-0.1204392,-0.2778642,-0.1108529,-1.650275,-0.8409651,-2.395932,-2.675014,-1.409489,-1.468031,-1.174764,-1.332189,-1.165177,-2.704599,-1.89529,-3.450256,1.265525,1.206983,1.500251,1.342826,1.509837,-0.02958501,0.7797248,-0.7752418,-0.0585418,0.2347255,0.07730056,0.2443118,-1.29511,-0.4858004,-2.040767,0.2932673,0.1358424,0.3028536,-1.236568,-0.4272586,-1.982225,-0.1574249,0.009586296,-1.529836,-0.7205259,-2.275493,0.1670112,-1.372411,-0.5631009,-2.118068,-1.539422,-0.7301122,-2.285079,0.8093098,-0.7456568,-1.554967

"281","AT1G48410","AGO1","Encodes an RNA Slicer that selectively recruits microRNAs and siRNAs.  There is currently no evidence that AGO1 Slicer is in a high molecular weight RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Mutants are defective in post-transcriptional gene silencing and have pleiotropic developmental and morphological defects. Through its action on the  regulation of ARF17 expression, the protein regulates genes involved at the cross talk between auxin and light signaling during adventitious root development.

"386","AT1G70660","MMZ2","MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.","NM_001198436",843403,"3702.AT1G70660.1","GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006464, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0019538, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-0.323634,-0.55392,-0.2827357,-0.588843,-0.5840769,-0.9986219,-0.3137059,-0.4144313,-0.2457743,-0.4927431,0.4421514,-0.230286,0.04089829,-0.265209,-0.2604429,-0.6749879,0.009928101,-0.09079732,0.07785974,-0.1691091,0.7657854,0.2711842,-0.034923,-0.03015693,-0.444702,0.2402141,0.1394886,0.3081457,0.06117684,0.9960713,-0.3061072,-0.3013412,-0.7158862,-0.03097019,-0.1316956,0.03696145,-0.2100074,0.7248871,0.004766069,-0.409779,0.2751371,0.1744116,0.3430687,0.09609983,1.030994,-0.414545,0.270371,0.1696456,0.3383026,0.09133377,1.026228,0.684916,0.5841906,0.7528477,0.5058788,1.440773,-0.1007254,0.06793164,-0.1790372,0.7558573,0.1686571,-0.0783118,0.8565827,-0.2469689,0.6879256,0.9348945,0.323634,0.55392,0.2827357,0.588843,0.5840769,0.9986219,0.3137059,0.4144313,0.2457743,0.4927431,-0.4421514,0.230286,-0.04089829,0.265209,0.2604429,0.6749879,-0.009928101,0.09079732,-0.07785974,0.1691091,-0.7657854,-0.2711842,0.034923,0.03015693,0.444702,-0.2402141,-0.1394886,-0.3081457,-0.06117684,-0.9960713,0.3061072,0.3013412,0.7158862,0.03097019,0.1316956,-0.03696145,0.2100074,-0.7248871,-0.004766069,0.409779,-0.2751371,-0.1744116,-0.3430687,-0.09609983,-1.030994,0.414545,-0.270371,-0.1696456,-0.3383026,-0.09133377,-1.026228,-0.684916,-0.5841906,-0.7528477,-0.5058788,-1.440773,0.1007254,-0.06793164,0.1790372,-0.7558573,-0.1686571,0.0783118,-0.8565827,0.2469689,-0.6879256,-0.9348945

"491","AT2G05710","ACO3","Encodes an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of citrate to isocitrate through a cis-aconitate intermediate, indicating that it may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways. The protein is believed to accumulate in the mitochondria and the cytosol. It affects CSD2 (At2g28190 - a superoxide dismutase) transcript levels and may play a role in the response to oxidative stress. One member of the family (ACO1 - At35830) was shown to specifically bind to the 5' UTR of CSD2 in vitro. ACO3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and its phosphorylation state is modulated in response to ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds.","NM_126589",815120,"3702.AT2G05710.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005975, GO:0006091, GO:0006099, GO:0006520, GO:0008152, GO:0008652, GO:0016829, GO:0016836, GO:0044238",0.6857007,0.4215146,0.3800945,0.4562834,0.4051586,0.5893676,0.1427366,1.301516,1.821751,0.8710193,1.229543,-0.2641861,-0.3056061,-0.2294172,-0.280542,-0.0963331,-0.5429641,0.6158155,1.13605,0.1853187,0.5438423,-0.04142007,0.03476883,-0.01635597,0.167853,-0.278778,0.8800016,1.400236,0.4495047,0.8080283,0.0761889,0.02506411,0.209273,-0.2373579,0.9214216,1.441656,0.4909248,0.8494484,-0.05112479,0.1330841,-0.3135468,0.8452327,1.365467,0.4147359,0.7732595,0.1842089,-0.2624221,0.8963575,1.416592,0.4658607,0.8243843,-0.446631,0.7121486,1.232383,0.2816518,0.6401754,1.15878,1.679014,0.7282827,1.086806,0.5202343,-0.4304968,-0.07197322,-0.9507312,-0.5922076,0.3585236,-0.6857007,-0.4215146,-0.3800945,-0.4562834,-0.4051586,-0.5893676,-0.1427366,-1.301516,-1.821751,-0.8710193,-1.229543,0.2641861,0.3056061,0.2294172,0.280542,0.0963331,0.5429641,-0.6158155,-1.13605,-0.1853187,-0.5438423,0.04142007,-0.03476883,0.01635597,-0.167853,0.278778,-0.8800016,-1.400236,-0.4495047,-0.8080283,-0.0761889,-0.02506411,-0.209273,0.2373579,-0.9214216,-1.441656,-0.4909248,-0.8494484,0.05112479,-0.1330841,0.3135468,-0.8452327,-1.365467,-0.4147359,-0.7732595,-0.1842089,0.2624221,-0.8963575,-1.416592,-0.4658607,-0.8243843,0.446631,-0.7121486,-1.232383,-0.2816518,-0.6401754,-1.15878,-1.679014,-0.7282827,-1.086806,-0.5202343,0.4304968,0.07197322,0.9507312,0.5922076,-0.3585236

"569","AT2G26300","ATGPA1","Encodes an alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein. The active GTP-bound form of GPA1 binds to the GTG1 and GTG2 abscisic acid (ABA) receptors and appears to affect their GTPase and GTP-binding activity, and hence, ABA binding abilities. GPA1 is a positive regulator in ABA-mediated inhibition of stomatal opening. Plants with recessive mutant alleles have complex phenotypes including: reduced brassinolide response, reduced cell divisions, round leaves, short hypocotyls.  It is likely to be involved in the signaling events that trigger unfolded protein response-associated cell death.

Homozygous plants with null mutations exhibit premature termination of the meristem and carpelloid structures from the inflorescence meristem. Co-activator of floral  homeotic gene expression. Acts with LFY to regulate shoot apical meristem identity. Required for meristem maintenance. Regulates  flowering under a non-inductive photoperiod. It promotes the expression of CUC2 during cotyledon boundary formation.  Affects reproductive shoot apical meristem function by regulating the expression of WUS. In CHiP experiments SYD binds to WUS promoter. Present as two forms in the nucleus, full-length and truncated, with the latter apparently lacking the C-terminal domain.

UEV1C can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ3/UEV1C transcripts are found at moderate levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen or 2 days after germination.

The true biological substrate(s) of UGT74F2 are not known, but mutant plants lacking UGT74F2 have a decreased level of SAG and SGE.","NM_129944",818986,"3702.AT2G43820.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0008152, GO:0016740, GO:0016757, GO:0043226, GO:0044464",0.03276448,0.9430312,1.459032,-0.09530588,0.6081368,0.4380682,0.6679257,0.1589297,1.025653,0.982526,2.32934,0.9102667,1.426267,-0.1280704,0.5753723,0.4053037,0.6351612,0.1261652,0.9928889,0.9497616,2.296575,0.5160007,-1.038337,-0.3348944,-0.5049629,-0.2751055,-0.7841015,0.08262219,0.03949489,1.386309,-1.554338,-0.8508951,-1.020964,-0.7911061,-1.300102,-0.4333785,-0.4765058,0.8703079,0.7034426,0.5333741,0.7632316,0.2542356,1.120959,1.077832,2.424646,-0.1700686,0.05978893,-0.4492071,0.4175166,0.3743893,1.721203,0.2298575,-0.2791385,0.5875851,0.5444578,1.891272,-0.508996,0.3577276,0.3146004,1.661414,0.8667237,0.8235964,2.17041,-0.0431273,1.303686,1.346814,-0.03276448,-0.9430312,-1.459032,0.09530588,-0.6081368,-0.4380682,-0.6679257,-0.1589297,-1.025653,-0.982526,-2.32934,-0.9102667,-1.426267,0.1280704,-0.5753723,-0.4053037,-0.6351612,-0.1261652,-0.9928889,-0.9497616,-2.296575,-0.5160007,1.038337,0.3348944,0.5049629,0.2751055,0.7841015,-0.08262219,-0.03949489,-1.386309,1.554338,0.8508951,1.020964,0.7911061,1.300102,0.4333785,0.4765058,-0.8703079,-0.7034426,-0.5333741,-0.7632316,-0.2542356,-1.120959,-1.077832,-2.424646,0.1700686,-0.05978893,0.4492071,-0.4175166,-0.3743893,-1.721203,-0.2298575,0.2791385,-0.5875851,-0.5444578,-1.891272,0.508996,-0.3577276,-0.3146004,-1.661414,-0.8667237,-0.8235964,-2.17041,0.0431273,-1.303686,-1.346814

"723","AT2G46370","AtGH3.11","Encodes a jasmonate-amido synthetase that is a member of the GH3 family of proteins. JAR1 catalyzes the formation of a biologically active jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate. JA-Ile promotes the interaction between JAZ1 and COI1 in the jasmonate signaling pathway. JAR1 localizes to the cytoplasm and is also a phytochrome A signaling component. JAR1 is an auxin-induced gene. Loss of function mutants are defective in a variety of responses to jasmonic acid. JAR1 has additional enzymatic activities in vitro, (e.g. the ability to synthesize adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate and other JA conjugates), but there are no data to show whether JAR1 catalyzes many of these reactions in vivo.

"842","AT3G13300","VCS","Encodes VCS (VARICOSE).   Involved in mRNA decapping.  VCS forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP1 (At1g08370) and DCP2 (At5g13570).  Unlike DCP2, VCS itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology.

TIC differentially regulates CCA1 and PRR9 from LHY, with LHY expression as a dominant genetic target of TIC action.","NM_001125204",821807,"3702.AT3G22380.2",NA,0.2894929,0.3408413,-0.01476186,0.1322986,-0.1143101,-0.1790953,0.3766036,0.4183589,0.07934445,0.1675369,-0.0795318,0.05134848,-0.3042547,-0.1571943,-0.403803,-0.4685882,0.08711074,0.128866,-0.2101484,-0.121956,-0.3690247,-0.3556032,-0.2085428,-0.4551514,-0.5199367,0.03576226,0.07751753,-0.2614969,-0.1733044,-0.4203731,0.1470604,-0.09954825,-0.1643335,0.3913655,0.4331207,0.09410631,0.1822988,-0.06476994,-0.2466087,-0.3113939,0.244305,0.2860603,-0.05295411,0.03523834,-0.2118304,-0.06478523,0.4909137,0.532669,0.1936546,0.281847,0.03477831,0.5556989,0.5974542,0.2584398,0.3466322,0.09956354,0.04175527,-0.2972591,-0.2090667,-0.4561354,-0.3390144,-0.250822,-0.4978907,0.08819244,-0.1588762,-0.2470687,-0.2894929,-0.3408413,0.01476186,-0.1322986,0.1143101,0.1790953,-0.3766036,-0.4183589,-0.07934445,-0.1675369,0.0795318,-0.05134848,0.3042547,0.1571943,0.403803,0.4685882,-0.08711074,-0.128866,0.2101484,0.121956,0.3690247,0.3556032,0.2085428,0.4551514,0.5199367,-0.03576226,-0.07751753,0.2614969,0.1733044,0.4203731,-0.1470604,0.09954825,0.1643335,-0.3913655,-0.4331207,-0.09410631,-0.1822988,0.06476994,0.2466087,0.3113939,-0.244305,-0.2860603,0.05295411,-0.03523834,0.2118304,0.06478523,-0.4909137,-0.532669,-0.1936546,-0.281847,-0.03477831,-0.5556989,-0.5974542,-0.2584398,-0.3466322,-0.09956354,-0.04175527,0.2972591,0.2090667,0.4561354,0.3390144,0.250822,0.4978907,-0.08819244,0.1588762,0.2470687

Can be phosphorylated by CK2alpha. In interphase cells, HMGB1 is found throughout the nucleus, whereas in mitotic cells it is not chromatin-associated.","NM_001084800",824351,NA,NA,0.05853601,-0.4405596,0.1632386,-0.07802326,-0.1287829,-0.1999681,0.3474241,-0.2322533,0.2120977,0.05872445,0.08927931,-0.4990956,0.1047026,-0.1365593,-0.1873189,-0.2585041,0.2888881,-0.2907893,0.1535617,0.000188435,0.0307433,0.6037982,0.3625363,0.3117767,0.2405915,0.7879836,0.2083063,0.6526573,0.499284,0.5298389,-0.2412619,-0.2920215,-0.3632067,0.1841855,-0.3954919,0.04885909,-0.1045142,-0.07395931,-0.05075964,-0.1219448,0.4254473,-0.15423,0.290121,0.1367477,0.1673026,-0.07118521,0.476207,-0.1034704,0.3408806,0.1875074,0.2180622,0.5473922,-0.03228517,0.4120658,0.2586926,0.2892474,-0.5796774,-0.1353264,-0.2886996,-0.2581448,0.444351,0.2909777,0.3215326,-0.1533733,-0.1228184,0.03055486,-0.05853601,0.4405596,-0.1632386,0.07802326,0.1287829,0.1999681,-0.3474241,0.2322533,-0.2120977,-0.05872445,-0.08927931,0.4990956,-0.1047026,0.1365593,0.1873189,0.2585041,-0.2888881,0.2907893,-0.1535617,-0.000188435,-0.0307433,-0.6037982,-0.3625363,-0.3117767,-0.2405915,-0.7879836,-0.2083063,-0.6526573,-0.499284,-0.5298389,0.2412619,0.2920215,0.3632067,-0.1841855,0.3954919,-0.04885909,0.1045142,0.07395931,0.05075964,0.1219448,-0.4254473,0.15423,-0.290121,-0.1367477,-0.1673026,0.07118521,-0.476207,0.1034704,-0.3408806,-0.1875074,-0.2180622,-0.5473922,0.03228517,-0.4120658,-0.2586926,-0.2892474,0.5796774,0.1353264,0.2886996,0.2581448,-0.444351,-0.2909777,-0.3215326,0.1533733,0.1228184,-0.03055486
"1017","AT3G51920","ATCML9","encodes a divergent member of calmodulin, which is an EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins. This gene is expressed in leaves, flowers and siliques. The gene functionally complements yeast calmodulin 1 (CAM1) but only  when selected against the plasmid harboring wild-type yeast sequences. Also the protein does not form formed a complex with a basic amphiphilic helical peptide in the presence of Ca2+ in vitro. Authors suggest that this gene may represent a Ca2+-binding sensor protein that interacts with a more limited set of target proteins than do more conventional CaM isoforms. Mutations in this gene alter plant responses to abiotic stress and abscisic acid.","NM_115051",824355,"3702.AT3G51920.1","GO:0005488, GO:0005509, GO:0005515, GO:0005516, GO:0006928, GO:0007049, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009987, GO:0019722, GO:0035556",-0.379531,-0.2706077,0.3535368,-0.537248,-0.3719481,-0.8520639,-0.03290943,-0.6239962,0.1594887,-0.2874016,1.276912,0.1089233,0.7330678,-0.157717,0.007582868,-0.4725329,0.3466216,-0.2444652,0.5390197,0.0921294,1.656443,0.6241445,-0.2666403,-0.1013404,-0.5814562,0.2376983,-0.3533885,0.4300964,-0.0167939,1.54752,-0.8907848,-0.725485,-1.205601,-0.3864463,-0.977533,-0.1940481,-0.6409384,0.923375,0.1652998,-0.3148159,0.5043385,-0.0867482,0.6967366,0.2498464,1.81416,-0.4801157,0.3390387,-0.252048,0.5314368,0.08454653,1.64886,0.8191544,0.2280677,1.011553,0.5646623,2.128976,-0.5910867,0.1923981,-0.2544922,1.309821,0.7834848,0.3365946,1.900908,-0.4468903,1.117423,1.564313,0.379531,0.2706077,-0.3535368,0.537248,0.3719481,0.8520639,0.03290943,0.6239962,-0.1594887,0.2874016,-1.276912,-0.1089233,-0.7330678,0.157717,-0.007582868,0.4725329,-0.3466216,0.2444652,-0.5390197,-0.0921294,-1.656443,-0.6241445,0.2666403,0.1013404,0.5814562,-0.2376983,0.3533885,-0.4300964,0.0167939,-1.54752,0.8907848,0.725485,1.205601,0.3864463,0.977533,0.1940481,0.6409384,-0.923375,-0.1652998,0.3148159,-0.5043385,0.0867482,-0.6967366,-0.2498464,-1.81416,0.4801157,-0.3390387,0.252048,-0.5314368,-0.08454653,-1.64886,-0.8191544,-0.2280677,-1.011553,-0.5646623,-2.128976,0.5910867,-0.1923981,0.2544922,-1.309821,-0.7834848,-0.3365946,-1.900908,0.4468903,-1.117423,-1.564313

"1051","AT3G55360","ATTSC13","Enoyl-CoA reductase is involved in all very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) elongation reactions that are required for cuticular wax, storage lipid and sphingolipid metabolism. The protein is located in the ER, but in contrast to its yeast homolog TSC13 is not particularly enriched in the nuclear envelope-vacuole junction. Mutants in this gene show abnormal organ morphology and stem glossiness. Cells in all tissues are only about 1/3 of the size of wild type cells. The morphological changes are most likely to result from the reduction in the VLCFA content of sphingolipids. Mutants also show abnormalities in the endocytic membrane organization and transport.","NM_115394",824702,"3702.AT3G55360.1","GO:0003824, GO:0016491, NA",-0.2159459,0.1746326,-0.02675818,0.143615,-0.08044097,0.2132994,-0.1726232,-0.2215353,-0.1953661,-0.07007472,-0.3407712,0.3905786,0.1891878,0.359561,0.135505,0.4292453,0.04332274,-0.005589316,0.02057982,0.1458712,-0.1248253,-0.2013908,-0.03101764,-0.2550736,0.03866675,-0.3472559,-0.3961679,-0.3699988,-0.2447074,-0.5154039,0.1703732,-0.05368279,0.2400576,-0.145865,-0.1947771,-0.1686079,-0.04331653,-0.314013,-0.224056,0.06968438,-0.3162382,-0.3651503,-0.3389811,-0.2136897,-0.4843862,0.2937404,-0.09218224,-0.1410943,-0.1149252,0.01036626,-0.2603302,-0.3859226,-0.4348347,-0.4086655,-0.2833741,-0.5540706,-0.04891205,-0.02274292,0.1025485,-0.168148,0.02616914,0.1514605,-0.1192359,0.1252914,-0.1454051,-0.2706965,0.2159459,-0.1746326,0.02675818,-0.143615,0.08044097,-0.2132994,0.1726232,0.2215353,0.1953661,0.07007472,0.3407712,-0.3905786,-0.1891878,-0.359561,-0.135505,-0.4292453,-0.04332274,0.005589316,-0.02057982,-0.1458712,0.1248253,0.2013908,0.03101764,0.2550736,-0.03866675,0.3472559,0.3961679,0.3699988,0.2447074,0.5154039,-0.1703732,0.05368279,-0.2400576,0.145865,0.1947771,0.1686079,0.04331653,0.314013,0.224056,-0.06968438,0.3162382,0.3651503,0.3389811,0.2136897,0.4843862,-0.2937404,0.09218224,0.1410943,0.1149252,-0.01036626,0.2603302,0.3859226,0.4348347,0.4086655,0.2833741,0.5540706,0.04891205,0.02274292,-0.1025485,0.168148,-0.02616914,-0.1514605,0.1192359,-0.1252914,0.1454051,0.2706965

"1189","AT4G14880","ATCYS-3A","Encodes a cytosolic isoform of cytosolic O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase, a key enzyme in cysteine biosynthesis and for the fixation of inorganic sulfide. It catalyzes the formation of cysteine from O-acetylserine and inorganic sulfide. Gene expression is predominant in the root cortex and the xylem parenchyma.  Gene expression is induced in leave, stems and roots by high salt and heavy metal stresses, mediated by ABA. Lines carrying semi-dominant mutations exhibit early senescence.","NM_001203803",827145,"3702.AT4G14880.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005488, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0006520, GO:0006790, GO:0006807, GO:0008152, GO:0008652, GO:0009058, GO:0009987, GO:0016829, GO:0044238, GO:0044464",0.325852,0.11383,0.6487166,0.3055335,0.5125793,0.2079586,0.3339638,0.2528144,0.8332924,0.09622636,0.8979939,-0.2120219,0.3228647,-0.02031844,0.1867273,-0.1178934,0.008111821,-0.07303758,0.5074404,-0.2296256,0.5721419,0.5348866,0.1917035,0.3987493,0.09412855,0.2201338,0.1389844,0.7194624,-0.01760365,0.7841639,-0.3431831,-0.1361373,-0.4407581,-0.3147529,-0.3959023,0.1845757,-0.5524903,0.2492772,0.2070458,-0.09757495,0.02843027,-0.05271913,0.5277589,-0.2093072,0.5924604,-0.3046207,-0.1786155,-0.2597649,0.3207131,-0.4163529,0.3854146,0.1260052,0.04485582,0.6253338,-0.1117322,0.6900353,-0.0811494,0.4993286,-0.2377374,0.5640301,0.580478,-0.156588,0.6451795,-0.737066,0.06470151,0.8017675,-0.325852,-0.11383,-0.6487166,-0.3055335,-0.5125793,-0.2079586,-0.3339638,-0.2528144,-0.8332924,-0.09622636,-0.8979939,0.2120219,-0.3228647,0.02031844,-0.1867273,0.1178934,-0.008111821,0.07303758,-0.5074404,0.2296256,-0.5721419,-0.5348866,-0.1917035,-0.3987493,-0.09412855,-0.2201338,-0.1389844,-0.7194624,0.01760365,-0.7841639,0.3431831,0.1361373,0.4407581,0.3147529,0.3959023,-0.1845757,0.5524903,-0.2492772,-0.2070458,0.09757495,-0.02843027,0.05271913,-0.5277589,0.2093072,-0.5924604,0.3046207,0.1786155,0.2597649,-0.3207131,0.4163529,-0.3854146,-0.1260052,-0.04485582,-0.6253338,0.1117322,-0.6900353,0.0811494,-0.4993286,0.2377374,-0.5640301,-0.580478,0.156588,-0.6451795,0.737066,-0.06470151,-0.8017675

"1352","AT4G35090","CAT2","Encodes a peroxisomal catalase, highly expressed in bolts and leaves.  mRNA expression patterns show circadian regulation with mRNA levels being high in the subjective early morning. Loss of function mutations have increased H2O2 levels and increased H2O2  sensitivity. Mutants accumulate more toxic ions yet show decreased sensitivity to Li+. This decreased sensitivity is most likely due to an insensitivity to ethylene.  Note that in Queval et al.

"1517","AT5G18170","GDH1","Encodes the 43 kDa alpha-subunit of the glutamate dehydrogenase with a putative mitochondrial transit polypeptide and NAD(H)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-binding domains. Mitochondrial localization confirmed by subcellular fractionation. Combines in several ratios with GDH2 protein (GDH-beta) to form seven isoenzymes. Catalyzes the cleavage of glycine residues. May be involved in ammonia assimilation under conditions of inorganic nitrogen excess. The enzyme is almost exclusively found in the mitochondria of stem and leaf companion cells.","NM_121822",831935,"3702.AT5G18170.1","GO:0003824, GO:0006520, GO:0008152, GO:0009063, GO:0016491, GO:0044238",0.3666129,0.03288973,0.4137538,-0.3624145,-0.01721387,-0.1313827,1.076221,0.4684545,1.002194,0.3902454,0.7315924,-0.3337232,0.04714083,-0.7290274,-0.3838268,-0.4979956,0.7096084,0.1018416,0.6355815,0.02363249,0.3649794,0.380864,-0.3953042,-0.0501036,-0.1642724,1.043332,0.4355648,0.9693047,0.3573557,0.6987026,-0.7761682,-0.4309676,-0.5451364,0.6624675,0.05470075,0.5884407,-0.02350834,0.3178386,0.3452006,0.2310318,1.438636,0.830869,1.364609,0.7526599,1.094007,-0.1141688,1.093435,0.4856684,1.019408,0.4074593,0.7488062,1.207604,0.5998372,1.133577,0.5216281,0.862975,-0.6077668,-0.07402686,-0.6859759,-0.3446289,0.5337399,-0.07820909,0.2631378,-0.611949,-0.2706021,0.3413469,-0.3666129,-0.03288973,-0.4137538,0.3624145,0.01721387,0.1313827,-1.076221,-0.4684545,-1.002194,-0.3902454,-0.7315924,0.3337232,-0.04714083,0.7290274,0.3838268,0.4979956,-0.7096084,-0.1018416,-0.6355815,-0.02363249,-0.3649794,-0.380864,0.3953042,0.0501036,0.1642724,-1.043332,-0.4355648,-0.9693047,-0.3573557,-0.6987026,0.7761682,0.4309676,0.5451364,-0.6624675,-0.05470075,-0.5884407,0.02350834,-0.3178386,-0.3452006,-0.2310318,-1.438636,-0.830869,-1.364609,-0.7526599,-1.094007,0.1141688,-1.093435,-0.4856684,-1.019408,-0.4074593,-0.7488062,-1.207604,-0.5998372,-1.133577,-0.5216281,-0.862975,0.6077668,0.07402686,0.6859759,0.3446289,-0.5337399,0.07820909,-0.2631378,0.611949,0.2706021,-0.3413469

PGL3 likely functions in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. pgl3 mutant phenotypes suggest that it is important in pathogen defense and maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis.","NM_122348",832511,"3702.AT5G24400.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005975, GO:0005996, GO:0006098, GO:0008152, GO:0016787, GO:0044238",-0.2738512,-0.3535709,0.1651285,-0.2292649,-0.09238271,0.1442163,-0.2428715,-0.4056356,0.09682206,-0.03761522,0.05290954,-0.07971974,0.4389797,0.04458629,0.1814685,0.4180675,0.0309797,-0.1317845,0.3706732,0.236236,0.3267607,0.5186994,0.124306,0.2611882,0.4977872,0.1106994,-0.05206472,0.450393,0.3159557,0.4064805,-0.3943934,-0.2575112,-0.0209122,-0.408,-0.5707642,-0.06830645,-0.2027437,-0.112219,0.1368822,0.3734812,-0.0136066,-0.1763708,0.3260869,0.1916497,0.2821744,0.236599,-0.1504888,-0.3132529,0.1892048,0.05476749,0.1452922,-0.3870878,-0.549852,-0.04739426,-0.1818315,-0.09130678,-0.1627642,0.3396935,0.2052563,0.295781,0.5024577,0.3680204,0.4585452,-0.1344373,-0.04391252,0.09052476,0.2738512,0.3535709,-0.1651285,0.2292649,0.09238271,-0.1442163,0.2428715,0.4056356,-0.09682206,0.03761522,-0.05290954,0.07971974,-0.4389797,-0.04458629,-0.1814685,-0.4180675,-0.0309797,0.1317845,-0.3706732,-0.236236,-0.3267607,-0.5186994,-0.124306,-0.2611882,-0.4977872,-0.1106994,0.05206472,-0.450393,-0.3159557,-0.4064805,0.3943934,0.2575112,0.0209122,0.408,0.5707642,0.06830645,0.2027437,0.112219,-0.1368822,-0.3734812,0.0136066,0.1763708,-0.3260869,-0.1916497,-0.2821744,-0.236599,0.1504888,0.3132529,-0.1892048,-0.05476749,-0.1452922,0.3870878,0.549852,0.04739426,0.1818315,0.09130678,0.1627642,-0.3396935,-0.2052563,-0.295781,-0.5024577,-0.3680204,-0.4585452,0.1344373,0.04391252,-0.09052476

"1636","AT5G42820","ATU2AF35B","U2 auxiliary factor small subunit. The atU2AF35b protein and its homolog, atU2AF35a, contain most of the conserved domains of hsU2AF35, including the psiRRM, one RS domain, two zinc fingers, and the two regions for interacting with U2AF large subunit. Both proteins lack the stretch of glycines present in human U2AF35. The sequences are overall 83% identical, and each Arabidopsis homolog shows approximately 70% similarity to hsU2AF35.    U2AF(35) homologs were also identified from maize, rice and other plants with large-scale EST projects. Both genes are expressed in all major tissues, with atU2AF(35)a expressed at a higher level than atU2AF(35)b in most tissues. The expression patterns were different in roots: atU2AF(35)b expressed strongly in whole young roots and root tips and atU2AF(35)a limited to root vascular regions.","NM_123647",834293,"3702.AT5G42820.1","GO:0000398, GO:0003676, GO:0003723, GO:0005488, GO:0006139, GO:0006397, GO:0008152, GO:0016070, GO:0030529, GO:0044238, GO:0032991",0.05309793,0.07307418,0.09549942,-0.291429,-0.3869089,-0.08369586,0.3418578,-0.1871006,0.1833467,0.09872003,0.1811205,0.01997625,0.04240149,-0.3445269,-0.4400068,-0.1367938,0.2887599,-0.2401985,0.1302488,0.0456221,0.1280226,0.02242524,-0.3645031,-0.4599831,-0.15677,0.2687837,-0.2601748,0.1102725,0.02564585,0.1080463,-0.3869284,-0.4824083,-0.1791953,0.2463584,-0.2826,0.08784728,0.003220609,0.0856211,-0.09547992,0.2077331,0.6332868,0.1043284,0.4747757,0.390149,0.4725495,0.303213,0.7287667,0.1998083,0.5702556,0.4856289,0.5680294,0.4255537,-0.1034047,0.2670426,0.1824159,0.2648164,-0.5289584,-0.1585111,-0.2431378,-0.1607373,0.3704473,0.2858206,0.3682211,-0.08462667,-0.002226183,0.08240049,-0.05309793,-0.07307418,-0.09549942,0.291429,0.3869089,0.08369586,-0.3418578,0.1871006,-0.1833467,-0.09872003,-0.1811205,-0.01997625,-0.04240149,0.3445269,0.4400068,0.1367938,-0.2887599,0.2401985,-0.1302488,-0.0456221,-0.1280226,-0.02242524,0.3645031,0.4599831,0.15677,-0.2687837,0.2601748,-0.1102725,-0.02564585,-0.1080463,0.3869284,0.4824083,0.1791953,-0.2463584,0.2826,-0.08784728,-0.003220609,-0.0856211,0.09547992,-0.2077331,-0.6332868,-0.1043284,-0.4747757,-0.390149,-0.4725495,-0.303213,-0.7287667,-0.1998083,-0.5702556,-0.4856289,-0.5680294,-0.4255537,0.1034047,-0.2670426,-0.1824159,-0.2648164,0.5289584,0.1585111,0.2431378,0.1607373,-0.3704473,-0.2858206,-0.3682211,0.08462667,0.002226183,-0.08240049

"1720","AT5G57090","AGR","Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors.

Two alternatively spliced versions of the transcript give rise to a longer peroxisomally-targeted protein (AT5G58220.1  (called TTL1-)) and a slightly shorter cytoplasmic protein (AT5G58220.3 (called TTL2-)). Both have roughly equivalent enzymatic activity in vitro, but, allantoin biosynthesis is believed to occur in the peroxisome suggesting that the cytosolic form may participate in a different process.","NM_001037016",835934,"3702.AT5G58220.1","",-0.11899,-0.09795691,0.1630935,-0.262905,-0.1835041,-0.00695203,0.2840194,-0.2221319,0.2890821,0.08697686,0.6335451,0.02103307,0.2820834,-0.143915,-0.06451411,0.112038,0.4030094,-0.1031419,0.408072,0.2059668,0.7525351,0.2610504,-0.164948,-0.08554718,0.09100488,0.3819763,-0.124175,0.387039,0.1849338,0.731502,-0.4259984,-0.3465975,-0.1700455,0.1209259,-0.3852254,0.1259886,-0.07611659,0.4704517,0.07940086,0.2559529,0.5469243,0.04077303,0.551987,0.3498818,0.8964501,0.1765521,0.4675235,-0.03862783,0.4725861,0.2704809,0.8170492,0.2909714,-0.2151799,0.2960341,0.09392889,0.6404972,-0.5061513,0.005062662,-0.1970425,0.3495257,0.511214,0.3091088,0.8556771,-0.2021052,0.3444631,0.5465683,0.11899,0.09795691,-0.1630935,0.262905,0.1835041,0.00695203,-0.2840194,0.2221319,-0.2890821,-0.08697686,-0.6335451,-0.02103307,-0.2820834,0.143915,0.06451411,-0.112038,-0.4030094,0.1031419,-0.408072,-0.2059668,-0.7525351,-0.2610504,0.164948,0.08554718,-0.09100488,-0.3819763,0.124175,-0.387039,-0.1849338,-0.731502,0.4259984,0.3465975,0.1700455,-0.1209259,0.3852254,-0.1259886,0.07611659,-0.4704517,-0.07940086,-0.2559529,-0.5469243,-0.04077303,-0.551987,-0.3498818,-0.8964501,-0.1765521,-0.4675235,0.03862783,-0.4725861,-0.2704809,-0.8170492,-0.2909714,0.2151799,-0.2960341,-0.09392889,-0.6404972,0.5061513,-0.005062662,0.1970425,-0.3495257,-0.511214,-0.3091088,-0.8556771,0.2021052,-0.3444631,-0.5465683

"1765","AT5G62440",NA,"Encodes a protein DOMINO1 that belongs to a plant-specific gene family sharing a common motif present in the tomato DEFECTIVE CHLOROPLASTS AND LEAVES (LeDCL) protein.  DOMINO1 is located in the nucleus.  Arabidopsis embryos carrying the domino1 mutation grow slowly in comparison with wild type embryos and reach only the globular stage at desiccation. The primary defect of the mutation at the cellular level is the large size of the nucleolus that can be observed soon after fertilization in the nuclei of both the embryo and the endosperm.  DOMINO1 might have a role in ribosome biogenesis and in determining the rate of cell division.","NM_125638",836365,NA,NA,-0.215089,-0.1437235,0.3034374,0.2618252,0.4200861,0.317471,-0.2239484,-0.2193255,-0.4121219,0.2723882,-1.164265,0.07136546,0.5185264,0.4769142,0.635175,0.53256,-0.008859408,-0.004236497,-0.1970329,0.4874772,-0.9491756,0.4471609,0.4055487,0.5638096,0.4611946,-0.08022487,-0.07560196,-0.2683984,0.4161117,-1.020541,-0.04161224,0.1166486,0.01403362,-0.5273858,-0.5227629,-0.7155593,-0.03104923,-1.467702,0.1582609,0.05564586,-0.4857736,-0.4811507,-0.6739471,0.01056301,-1.42609,-0.102615,-0.6440344,-0.6394115,-0.832208,-0.1476979,-1.584351,-0.5414194,-0.5367965,-0.7295929,-0.04508285,-1.481736,0.00462291,-0.1881735,0.4963366,-0.9403162,-0.1927964,0.4917137,-0.9449391,0.6845101,-0.7521426,-1.436653,0.215089,0.1437235,-0.3034374,-0.2618252,-0.4200861,-0.317471,0.2239484,0.2193255,0.4121219,-0.2723882,1.164265,-0.07136546,-0.5185264,-0.4769142,-0.635175,-0.53256,0.008859408,0.004236497,0.1970329,-0.4874772,0.9491756,-0.4471609,-0.4055487,-0.5638096,-0.4611946,0.08022487,0.07560196,0.2683984,-0.4161117,1.020541,0.04161224,-0.1166486,-0.01403362,0.5273858,0.5227629,0.7155593,0.03104923,1.467702,-0.1582609,-0.05564586,0.4857736,0.4811507,0.6739471,-0.01056301,1.42609,0.102615,0.6440344,0.6394115,0.832208,0.1476979,1.584351,0.5414194,0.5367965,0.7295929,0.04508285,1.481736,-0.00462291,0.1881735,-0.4963366,0.9403162,0.1927964,-0.4917137,0.9449391,-0.6845101,0.7521426,1.436653

"1795","AT5G66690","UGT72E2","UGT72E2 is an UDPG:coniferyl alcohol glucosyltransferase which glucosylates sinapyl- and coniferyl aldehydes as well as sinapyl- and coniferyl alcohol. The enzyme is thought to be involved in lignin metabolism. A knockdown mutant line (72E2KD) was obtained using RNAi silencing. A twofold reduction in coniferyl alcohol 4-<i>O</i>-glucoside and sinapyl alcohol 4-<i>O</i>-glucoside was detected in this line compared to wildtype. In comparison, both knockout and knockdown lines of UGT72E1 and UGT72E3, respectively, failed to display the same reduction in phenylpropanoid 4-<i>O</i>-glucosides.","NM_126067",836802,"3702.AT5G66690.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0008152, GO:0016740, GO:0016757, GO:0043226, GO:0044464",0.2278619,1.099984,1.537205,0.3233859,0.8068447,0.9789368,0.8915736,0.7892891,1.672097,1.18943,1.037896,0.8721225,1.309344,0.09552406,0.5789828,0.7510749,0.6637118,0.5614272,1.444235,0.9615681,0.8100342,0.437221,-0.7765984,-0.2931397,-0.1210476,-0.2084107,-0.3106953,0.5721123,0.08944563,-0.06208832,-1.213819,-0.7303607,-0.5582686,-0.6456318,-0.7479163,0.1348912,-0.3477754,-0.4993094,0.4834587,0.6555508,0.5681877,0.4659031,1.348711,0.8660441,0.7145101,0.1720921,0.08472897,-0.01755561,0.865252,0.3825853,0.2310514,-0.08736312,-0.1896477,0.6931599,0.2104932,0.05895927,-0.1022846,0.780523,0.2978563,0.1463224,0.8828076,0.4001409,0.248607,-0.4826667,-0.6342006,-0.1515339,-0.2278619,-1.099984,-1.537205,-0.3233859,-0.8068447,-0.9789368,-0.8915736,-0.7892891,-1.672097,-1.18943,-1.037896,-0.8721225,-1.309344,-0.09552406,-0.5789828,-0.7510749,-0.6637118,-0.5614272,-1.444235,-0.9615681,-0.8100342,-0.437221,0.7765984,0.2931397,0.1210476,0.2084107,0.3106953,-0.5721123,-0.08944563,0.06208832,1.213819,0.7303607,0.5582686,0.6456318,0.7479163,-0.1348912,0.3477754,0.4993094,-0.4834587,-0.6555508,-0.5681877,-0.4659031,-1.348711,-0.8660441,-0.7145101,-0.1720921,-0.08472897,0.01755561,-0.865252,-0.3825853,-0.2310514,0.08736312,0.1896477,-0.6931599,-0.2104932,-0.05895927,0.1022846,-0.780523,-0.2978563,-0.1463224,-0.8828076,-0.4001409,-0.248607,0.4826667,0.6342006,0.1515339
