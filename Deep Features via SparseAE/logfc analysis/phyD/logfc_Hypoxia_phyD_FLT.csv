AT1G04250,AXR3,"Transcription regulator acting as repressor of auxin-inducible gene expression. Auxin-inducible AUX/IAA gene. Short-lived nuclear protein with four conserved domains. Domain III has homology to beta alpha alpha dimerization and DNA binding domains. Involved in auxin signaling. Auxin induces the degradation of the protein in a dosage-dependent manner in a process mediated by AtRac1.

AT1G15750,TPL,"Encodes a protein with several WD40 repeats at the C-terminus and predicted protein-protein interaction domains at the N-terminus.  Together with the TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS (TPRs), it is thought to be involved in transcriptional repression of root-promoting genes in the top half of the embryo during the transition stage of embryogenesis. It can also interact with IAA12 through the EAR domain of IAA12 and the CTLH domain of TPL. The ability of IAA12 to repress transcription is diminished in a tpl-1 mutant background.",NM_001035973,838144,3702.AT1G15750.1,NA,0.160329763,0.459478667,-0.409616949,0.232055906,-0.549427431,-0.155900716,0.036053538,0.374947092,-0.051403994,0.035846717,-0.126929564,0.299148904,-0.569946712,0.071726143,-0.709757193,-0.316230478,-0.124276225,0.214617329,-0.211733756,-0.124483045,-0.287259327,-0.869095616,-0.227422761,-1.008906097,-0.615379382,-0.423425129,-0.084531575,-0.51088266,-0.423631949,-0.586408231,0.641672855,-0.139810481,0.253716234,0.445670487,0.784564041,0.358212956,0.445463667,0.282687385,-0.781483337,-0.387956622,-0.196002368,0.142891186,-0.2834599,-0.196209189,-0.358985471,0.393526715,0.585480969,0.924374523,0.498023437,0.585274148,0.422497866,0.191954254,0.530847808,0.104496722,0.191747433,0.028971151,0.338893554,-0.087457532,-0.000206821,-0.162983102,-0.426351086,-0.339100375,-0.501876656,0.087250711,-0.075525571,-0.162776282,-0.160329763,-0.459478667,0.409616949,-0.232055906,0.549427431,0.155900716,-0.036053538,-0.374947092,0.051403994,-0.035846717,0.126929564,-0.299148904,0.569946712,-0.071726143,0.709757193,0.316230478,0.124276225,-0.214617329,0.211733756,0.124483045,0.287259327,0.869095616,0.227422761,1.008906097,0.615379382,0.423425129,0.084531575,0.51088266,0.423631949,0.586408231,-0.641672855,0.139810481,-0.253716234,-0.445670487,-0.784564041,-0.358212956,-0.445463667,-0.282687385,0.781483337,0.387956622,0.196002368,-0.142891186,0.2834599,0.196209189,0.358985471,-0.393526715,-0.585480969,-0.924374523,-0.498023437,-0.585274148,-0.422497866,-0.191954254,-0.530847808,-0.104496722,-0.191747433,-0.028971151,-0.338893554,0.087457532,0.000206821,0.162983102,0.426351086,0.339100375,0.501876656,-0.087250711,0.075525571,0.162776282

AT1G19350,BES1,"Encodes brassinosteroid (BR) signalling protein that accumulates in the nucleus as dephosphorylated form in response to BRs. Is phosphorylated by the BIN2 GSK3 kinase. It synergistically interacts with BIM1 to bind to E box sequences (CANNTG). The protein contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), followed by a highly conserved amino-terminal domain (N) shared by all family members, a BIN2 phosphorylation domain (P), a PEST motif, involved in protein degradation in the absence of BR, and a carboxyl-terminal domain.

AT1G23080,ATPIN7,"Encodes a novel component of auxin efflux that is located  apically in the basal cell and is involved during embryogenesis in setting up the apical-basal axis in the embryo.  It is also involved in pattern specification during root development.  In roots, it is expressed at lateral and basal membranes of provascular cells in the meristem and elongation zone, whereas in the columella cells it coincides with the PIN3 domain. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. PINs are directly involved of in catalyzing  cellular auxin efflux.",NM_001084115,838916,3702.AT1G23080.1,"GO:0005215, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005783, GO:0005886, GO:0006810, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009719, GO:0009987, GO:0016020, GO:0022857, GO:0042592, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0051179, GO:0065007, NA",0.467619176,-0.380384787,-0.344726572,0.41379706,-0.912974699,-0.210138966,0.078611467,0.448111432,0.062127271,0.024302371,0.184575053,-0.848003963,-0.812345748,-0.053822115,-1.380593875,-0.677758141,-0.389007708,-0.019507744,-0.405491904,-0.443316805,-0.283044123,0.035658215,0.794181848,-0.532589912,0.170245822,0.458996255,0.828496219,0.442512059,0.404687158,0.564959841,0.758523632,-0.568248127,0.134587606,0.423338039,0.792838004,0.406853843,0.369028943,0.529301625,-1.32677176,-0.623936026,-0.335185593,0.034314371,-0.351669789,-0.38949469,-0.229222007,0.702835734,0.991586167,1.361086131,0.97510197,0.93727707,1.097549752,0.288750433,0.658250397,0.272266237,0.234441336,0.394714019,0.369499964,-0.016484196,-0.054309097,0.105963586,-0.38598416,-0.423809061,-0.263536378,-0.037824901,0.122447782,0.160272682,-0.467619176,0.380384787,0.344726572,-0.41379706,0.912974699,0.210138966,-0.078611467,-0.448111432,-0.062127271,-0.024302371,-0.184575053,0.848003963,0.812345748,0.053822115,1.380593875,0.677758141,0.389007708,0.019507744,0.405491904,0.443316805,0.283044123,-0.035658215,-0.794181848,0.532589912,-0.170245822,-0.458996255,-0.828496219,-0.442512059,-0.404687158,-0.564959841,-0.758523632,0.568248127,-0.134587606,-0.423338039,-0.792838004,-0.406853843,-0.369028943,-0.529301625,1.32677176,0.623936026,0.335185593,-0.034314371,0.351669789,0.38949469,0.229222007,-0.702835734,-0.991586167,-1.361086131,-0.97510197,-0.93727707,-1.097549752,-0.288750433,-0.658250397,-0.272266237,-0.234441336,-0.394714019,-0.369499964,0.016484196,0.054309097,-0.105963586,0.38598416,0.423809061,0.263536378,0.037824901,-0.122447782,-0.160272682

AT1G35720,ANN1,"Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion.",NM_103274,840476,3702.AT1G35720.1,"GO:0006631, GO:0006629, GO:0008152, GO:0044238",0.5848507,-0.4694737,2.205541,0.9400155,0.9985573,0.70529,0.8627149,0.6957037,2.235126,1.425816,2.980782,-1.054324,1.62069,0.3551647,0.4137065,0.1204392,0.2778642,0.1108529,1.650275,0.8409651,2.395932,2.675014,1.409489,1.468031,1.174764,1.332189,1.165177,2.704599,1.89529,3.450256,-1.265525,-1.206983,-1.500251,-1.342826,-1.509837,0.02958501,-0.7797248,0.7752418,0.0585418,-0.2347255,-0.07730056,-0.2443118,1.29511,0.4858004,2.040767,-0.2932673,-0.1358424,-0.3028536,1.236568,0.4272586,1.982225,0.1574249,-0.009586296,1.529836,0.7205259,2.275493,-0.1670112,1.372411,0.5631009,2.118068,1.539422,0.7301122,2.285079,-0.8093098,0.7456568,1.554967,-0.5848507,0.4694737,-2.205541,-0.9400155,-0.9985573,-0.70529,-0.8627149,-0.6957037,-2.235126,-1.425816,-2.980782,1.054324,-1.62069,-0.3551647,-0.4137065,-0.1204392,-0.2778642,-0.1108529,-1.650275,-0.8409651,-2.395932,-2.675014,-1.409489,-1.468031,-1.174764,-1.332189,-1.165177,-2.704599,-1.89529,-3.450256,1.265525,1.206983,1.500251,1.342826,1.509837,-0.02958501,0.7797248,-0.7752418,-0.0585418,0.2347255,0.07730056,0.2443118,-1.29511,-0.4858004,-2.040767,0.2932673,0.1358424,0.3028536,-1.236568,-0.4272586,-1.982225,-0.1574249,0.009586296,-1.529836,-0.7205259,-2.275493,0.1670112,-1.372411,-0.5631009,-2.118068,-1.539422,-0.7301122,-2.285079,0.8093098,-0.7456568,-1.554967

AT1G70660,MMZ2,"MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast.

AT2G01420,ATPIN4,"Encodes a putative auxin efflux carrier that is localized in developing and mature root meristems.  It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  A role for AtPIN4 in generating a sink for auxin below the quiescent center of the root meristem that is essential for auxin distribution and patterning is proposed. In the root, PIN4 is detected around the quiescent center and cells surrounding it, and localizes basally in provascular cells. PIN4 expression is upregulated in brassinosteroid-insensitive mutant (PMID 16141452).",NM_001335061,814670,3702.AT2G01420.2,"GO:0005215, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005783, GO:0005886, GO:0006810, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009719, GO:0009987, GO:0016020, GO:0022857, GO:0042592, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0051179, GO:0065007, NA",0.4398166,0.09356553,0.1420656,0.8196517,-0.2984353,0.3822229,0.7639724,0.8618948,0.9639327,0.4849003,1.097346,-0.3462511,-0.297751,0.379835,-0.7382519,-0.05759376,0.3241558,0.4220781,0.524116,0.04508367,0.6575293,0.04850009,0.7260861,-0.3920008,0.2886573,0.6704069,0.7683292,0.8703672,0.3913348,1.00378,0.677586,-0.4405009,0.2401573,0.6219068,0.7198291,0.8218671,0.3428347,0.9552803,-1.118087,-0.4374288,-0.05567927,0.04224309,0.144281,-0.3347514,0.2776943,0.6806582,1.062408,1.16033,1.262368,0.7833356,1.395781,0.3817495,0.4796719,0.5817098,0.1026774,0.715123,0.09792235,0.1999603,-0.2790721,0.3333735,0.1020379,-0.3769945,0.2354512,-0.4790324,0.1334132,0.6124456,-0.4398166,-0.09356553,-0.1420656,-0.8196517,0.2984353,-0.3822229,-0.7639724,-0.8618948,-0.9639327,-0.4849003,-1.097346,0.3462511,0.297751,-0.379835,0.7382519,0.05759376,-0.3241558,-0.4220781,-0.524116,-0.04508367,-0.6575293,-0.04850009,-0.7260861,0.3920008,-0.2886573,-0.6704069,-0.7683292,-0.8703672,-0.3913348,-1.00378,-0.677586,0.4405009,-0.2401573,-0.6219068,-0.7198291,-0.8218671,-0.3428347,-0.9552803,1.118087,0.4374288,0.05567927,-0.04224309,-0.144281,0.3347514,-0.2776943,-0.6806582,-1.062408,-1.16033,-1.262368,-0.7833356,-1.395781,-0.3817495,-0.4796719,-0.5817098,-0.1026774,-0.715123,-0.09792235,-0.1999603,0.2790721,-0.3333735,-0.1020379,0.3769945,-0.2354512,0.4790324,-0.1334132,-0.6124456

AT2G05710,ACO3,"Encodes an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of citrate to isocitrate through a cis-aconitate intermediate, indicating that it may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways. The protein is believed to accumulate in the mitochondria and the cytosol. It affects CSD2 (At2g28190 - a superoxide dismutase) transcript levels and may play a role in the response to oxidative stress.

AT3G13300,VCS,"Encodes VCS (VARICOSE).   Involved in mRNA decapping.  VCS forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP1 (At1g08370) and DCP2 (At5g13570).  Unlike DCP2, VCS itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate.

AT3G16770,ATEBP,"Encodes a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-2 of the plant specific ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (RAP2.3).  The protein contains one AP2 domain. There are 5 members in this subfamily including RAP2.2 AND RAP2.12.It is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator through the GCC-box. It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6.   It is part of the ethylene signaling pathway and is predicted to act downstream of EIN2 and CTR1, but not under EIN3.",NM_112550,820929,3702.AT3G16770.1,NA,0.7023102,0.9355498,1.053383,1.139028,-2.3064,-0.2267675,1.287293,1.029405,1.567726,2.034803,1.795111,0.2332395,0.3510723,0.4367179,-3.008711,-0.9290778,0.5849829,0.3270943,0.8654153,1.332493,1.092801,0.1178327,0.2034784,-3.24195,-1.162317,0.3517434,0.0938548,0.6321758,1.099253,0.8595616,0.08564567,-3.359783,-1.28015,0.2339107,-0.02397794,0.5143431,0.9814204,0.7417288,-3.445429,-1.365796,0.148265,-0.1096236,0.4286974,0.8957748,0.6560832,2.079633,3.593694,3.335805,3.874126,4.341203,4.101512,1.514061,1.256172,1.794493,2.26157,2.021879,-0.2578886,0.2804324,0.7475098,0.5078182,0.538321,1.005398,0.7657068,0.4670774,0.2273858,-0.2396916,-0.7023102,-0.9355498,-1.053383,-1.139028,2.3064,0.2267675,-1.287293,-1.029405,-1.567726,-2.034803,-1.795111,-0.2332395,-0.3510723,-0.4367179,3.008711,0.9290778,-0.5849829,-0.3270943,-0.8654153,-1.332493,-1.092801,-0.1178327,-0.2034784,3.24195,1.162317,-0.3517434,-0.0938548,-0.6321758,-1.099253,-0.8595616,-0.08564567,3.359783,1.28015,-0.2339107,0.02397794,-0.5143431,-0.9814204,-0.7417288,3.445429,1.365796,-0.148265,0.1096236,-0.4286974,-0.8957748,-0.6560832,-2.079633,-3.593694,-3.335805,-3.874126,-4.341203,-4.101512,-1.514061,-1.256172,-1.794493,-2.26157,-2.021879,0.2578886,-0.2804324,-0.7475098,-0.5078182,-0.538321,-1.005398,-0.7657068,-0.4670774,-0.2273858,0.2396916

AT3G28860,ABCB19,"Belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Also known as AtMDR11 and PGP19. Possibly regulates auxin-dependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin transport in the root. Acts upstream of phyA in regulating hypocotyl elongation and gravitropic response. Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AtPGP1.",NM_113807,822519,3702.AT3G28860.1,NA,0.07524476,0.3307835,-0.4281609,0.4512846,-0.2527365,0.4382581,0.07115669,0.6051104,-0.4159955,-0.1932972,-0.4723344,0.2555388,-0.5034056,0.3760398,-0.3279812,0.3630133,-0.004088073,0.5298657,-0.4912402,-0.268542,-0.5475792,-0.7589444,0.120501,-0.58352,0.1074745,-0.2596269,0.2743269,-0.746779,-0.5240808,-0.8031179,0.8794454,0.1754244,0.8664189,0.4993176,1.033271,0.01216543,0.2348637,-0.04417351,-0.704021,-0.0130265,-0.3801279,0.1538259,-0.86728,-0.6445818,-0.9236189,0.6909945,0.3238932,0.8578469,-0.163259,0.05943925,-0.2195979,-0.3671014,0.1668524,-0.8542535,-0.6315553,-0.9105924,0.5339538,-0.4871521,-0.2644539,-0.5434911,-1.021106,-0.7984077,-1.077445,0.2226982,-0.05633894,-0.2790372,-0.07524476,-0.3307835,0.4281609,-0.4512846,0.2527365,-0.4382581,-0.07115669,-0.6051104,0.4159955,0.1932972,0.4723344,-0.2555388,0.5034056,-0.3760398,0.3279812,-0.3630133,0.004088073,-0.5298657,0.4912402,0.268542,0.5475792,0.7589444,-0.120501,0.58352,-0.1074745,0.2596269,-0.2743269,0.746779,0.5240808,0.8031179,-0.8794454,-0.1754244,-0.8664189,-0.4993176,-1.033271,-0.01216543,-0.2348637,0.04417351,0.704021,0.0130265,0.3801279,-0.1538259,0.86728,0.6445818,0.9236189,-0.6909945,-0.3238932,-0.8578469,0.163259,-0.05943925,0.2195979,0.3671014,-0.1668524,0.8542535,0.6315553,0.9105924,-0.5339538,0.4871521,0.2644539,0.5434911,1.021106,0.7984077,1.077445,-0.2226982,0.05633894,0.2790372

AT3G46640,LUX,"Encodes a myb family transcription factor with a single Myb DNA-binding domain (type SHAQKYF) that is unique to plants and is essential for circadian rhythms, specifically for transcriptional regulation within the circadian clock.

AT3G51920,ATCML9,"encodes a divergent member of calmodulin, which is an EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins. This gene is expressed in leaves, flowers and siliques. The gene functionally complements yeast calmodulin 1 (CAM1) but only  when selected against the plasmid harboring wild-type yeast sequences. Also the protein does not form formed a complex with a basic amphiphilic helical peptide in the presence of Ca2+ in vitro. Authors suggest that this gene may represent a Ca2+-binding sensor protein that interacts with a more limited set of target proteins than do more conventional CaM isoforms.

TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers.

AT4G12420,SKU5,"Encodes a protein of unknown function involved in directed root tip growth. It is a member of 19-member gene family and is distantly related structurally to the multiple-copper oxidases ascorbate oxidase and laccase, though it lacks the copper-binding domains. The protein is glycosylated and GPI-anchored. It is localized to the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The gene is expressed most strongly in expanding tissues.",NM_001203775,826851,3702.AT4G12420.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0005488, GO:0005886, GO:0008152, GO:0016020, GO:0016491, GO:0044464",0.302419,0.4353588,-0.03364303,0.707059,0.5376045,0.5273795,-0.06032853,0.2202135,-0.08311952,0.1573674,-0.142271,0.1329397,-0.3360621,0.40464,0.2351855,0.2249605,-0.3627476,-0.08220551,-0.3855386,-0.1450516,-0.44469,-0.4690018,0.2717003,0.1022457,0.09202073,-0.4956873,-0.2151452,-0.5184783,-0.2779913,-0.5776297,0.7407021,0.5712476,0.5610225,-0.02668549,0.2538566,-0.04947649,0.1910105,-0.1086279,-0.1694545,-0.1796795,-0.7673876,-0.4868455,-0.7901786,-0.5496916,-0.84933,-0.01022502,-0.597933,-0.317391,-0.620724,-0.3802371,-0.6798755,-0.587708,-0.307166,-0.610499,-0.3700121,-0.6696505,0.2805421,-0.02279099,0.217696,-0.08194244,-0.3033331,-0.0628461,-0.3624845,0.240487,-0.05915145,-0.2996384,-0.302419,-0.4353588,0.03364303,-0.707059,-0.5376045,-0.5273795,0.06032853,-0.2202135,0.08311952,-0.1573674,0.142271,-0.1329397,0.3360621,-0.40464,-0.2351855,-0.2249605,0.3627476,0.08220551,0.3855386,0.1450516,0.44469,0.4690018,-0.2717003,-0.1022457,-0.09202073,0.4956873,0.2151452,0.5184783,0.2779913,0.5776297,-0.7407021,-0.5712476,-0.5610225,0.02668549,-0.2538566,0.04947649,-0.1910105,0.1086279,0.1694545,0.1796795,0.7673876,0.4868455,0.7901786,0.5496916,0.84933,0.01022502,0.597933,0.317391,0.620724,0.3802371,0.6798755,0.587708,0.307166,0.610499,0.3700121,0.6696505,-0.2805421,0.02279099,-0.217696,0.08194244,0.3033331,0.0628461,0.3624845,-0.240487,0.05915145,0.2996384

AT4G34350,CLB6,Arabidopsis ISPH is involved in the plastid nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. It was shown to complement the lethal phenotype of E. coli ispH mutant and is therefore most likely encodes a protein with 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase activity involved in the last step of mevalonate-independent isopentenyl biosynthesis.

AT5G22000,RHF2A,encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in gametogenesis. Double mutant analyses with RHF1a suggests that RHF2a may be involved in targetting ICK4KRP6 for degradation following meiosis in order to allow the mitoses associated with megagametogenesis and microgametogenesis to occur. RHF2a is expressed in all four floral whorls and is present at ~8-fold higher levels than RHF1a in inflorescences by RT-PCR analyses.,NM_001343714,832260,3702.AT5G22000.1,NA,0.295803,0.08106124,0.3584165,-0.3418938,-0.005894816,-0.317245,0.4872914,0.5733692,0.6408603,0.4054038,1.345299,-0.2147417,0.06261357,-0.6376968,-0.3016978,-0.6130479,0.1914885,0.2775662,0.3450574,0.1096009,1.049496,0.2773553,-0.422955,-0.08695605,-0.3983062,0.4062302,0.4923079,0.5597991,0.3243426,1.264238,-0.7003103,-0.3643113,-0.6756615,0.1288749,0.2149526,0.2824438,0.04698729,0.9868823,0.335999,0.02464882,0.8291852,0.915263,0.9827541,0.7472976,1.687193,-0.3113502,0.4931862,0.579264,0.6467551,0.4112986,1.351194,0.8045364,0.8906141,0.9581053,0.7226488,1.662544,0.08607775,0.1535689,-0.0818876,0.8580074,0.06749115,-0.1679653,0.7719297,-0.2354565,0.7044385,0.939895,-0.295803,-0.08106124,-0.3584165,0.3418938,0.005894816,0.317245,-0.4872914,-0.5733692,-0.6408603,-0.4054038,-1.345299,0.2147417,-0.06261357,0.6376968,0.3016978,0.6130479,-0.1914885,-0.2775662,-0.3450574,-0.1096009,-1.049496,-0.2773553,0.422955,0.08695605,0.3983062,-0.4062302,-0.4923079,-0.5597991,-0.3243426,-1.264238,0.7003103,0.3643113,0.6756615,-0.1288749,-0.2149526,-0.2824438,-0.04698729,-0.9868823,-0.335999,-0.02464882,-0.8291852,-0.915263,-0.9827541,-0.7472976,-1.687193,0.3113502,-0.4931862,-0.579264,-0.6467551,-0.4112986,-1.351194,-0.8045364,-0.8906141,-0.9581053,-0.7226488,-1.662544,-0.08607775,-0.1535689,0.0818876,-0.8580074,-0.06749115,0.1679653,-0.7719297,0.2354565,-0.7044385,-0.939895

AT5G54160,ATOMT1,A caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O-methyltransferase. Interacts with 14-4-3 proteins in yeast 2 hybrid assay.  AtOMT1 (At5g54160) encodes a flavonol 3-O-methyltransferase that is highly active towards quercetin and myricetin. The substrate specificity identifies the enzyme as flavonol 3-methyltransferase which replaces the former annotation of the gene to encode a caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O-methyltransferase,NM_124796,835504,3702.AT5G54160.1,"GO:0003824, GO:0008152, GO:0008168, GO:0009058, GO:0009987, GO:0016740",0.04138925,-0.2551935,-0.09416052,-0.1409054,0.66476,-0.395352,-0.5777121,-0.8829585,-0.6513822,-0.3457922,0.3736156,-0.2965827,-0.1355498,-0.1822947,0.6233707,-0.4367412,-0.6191013,-0.9243478,-0.6927715,-0.3871815,0.3322263,0.161033,0.1142881,0.9199535,-0.1401585,-0.3225186,-0.627765,-0.3961887,-0.09059871,0.6288091,-0.0467449,0.7589205,-0.3011914,-0.4835515,-0.788798,-0.5572217,-0.2516317,0.4677761,0.8056654,-0.2544465,-0.4368066,-0.7420531,-0.5104768,-0.2048868,0.514521,-1.060112,-1.242472,-1.547719,-1.316142,-1.010552,-0.2911444,-0.1823601,-0.4876066,-0.2560303,0.04955975,0.7689675,-0.3052465,-0.07367018,0.2319199,0.9513276,0.2315763,0.5371663,1.256574,0.30559,1.024998,0.7194078,-0.04138925,0.2551935,0.09416052,0.1409054,-0.66476,0.395352,0.5777121,0.8829585,0.6513822,0.3457922,-0.3736156,0.2965827,0.1355498,0.1822947,-0.6233707,0.4367412,0.6191013,0.9243478,0.6927715,0.3871815,-0.3322263,-0.161033,-0.1142881,-0.9199535,0.1401585,0.3225186,0.627765,0.3961887,0.09059871,-0.6288091,0.0467449,-0.7589205,0.3011914,0.4835515,0.788798,0.5572217,0.2516317,-0.4677761,-0.8056654,0.2544465,0.4368066,0.7420531,0.5104768,0.2048868,-0.514521,1.060112,1.242472,1.547719,1.316142,1.010552,0.2911444,0.1823601,0.4876066,0.2560303,-0.04955975,-0.7689675,0.3052465,0.07367018,-0.2319199,-0.9513276,-0.2315763,-0.5371663,-1.256574,-0.30559,-1.024998,-0.7194078

AT5G55300,MGO1,Encodes a type-I DNA topoisomerase I. Disruptions in this gene affect phyllotaxis and plant architecture suggesting that the gene plays a critical role in the maintenance of a regular pattern of organ initiation. Isolated as a protein oxidized during seed germination; proteomics approach revealed differences in de novo synthesis levels of this protein in condition with vs. without salicylic acid in the period from 0 to 40 hrs. following seed imbibition. Functions in stem cell maintenance at all stages of shoot and floral meristems and in the regulation of gene silencing.,NM_001203614,835623,3702.AT5G55300.2,"GO:0000228, GO:0003676, GO:0003677, GO:0003824, GO:0003916, GO:0005488, GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0005654, GO:0005694, GO:0005730, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006260, GO:0006325, GO:0006338, GO:0006807, GO:0006996, GO:0007059, GO:0008152, GO:0009058, GO:0009987, GO:0016043, GO:0016853, GO:0032991, GO:0032993, GO:0043226, GO:0043234, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",0.01947381,-0.06027752,-0.02743062,0.1325999,-0.09309307,0.08839182,0.2599924,0.1927663,0.1149986,-0.05441036,-0.05614238,-0.07975134,-0.04690443,0.1131261,-0.1125669,0.068918,0.2405186,0.1732925,0.09552476,-0.07388417,-0.0756162,0.0328469,0.1928774,-0.03281555,0.1486693,0.32027,0.2530438,0.1752761,0.005867167,0.00413514,0.1600305,-0.06566245,0.1158224,0.2874231,0.2201969,0.1424292,-0.02697974,-0.02871176,-0.225693,-0.04420809,0.1273925,0.0601664,-0.01760133,-0.1870103,-0.1887423,0.1814849,0.3530855,0.2858594,0.2080917,0.03868272,0.03695069,0.1716006,0.1043745,0.02660676,-0.1428022,-0.1445342,-0.06722614,-0.1449939,-0.3144028,-0.3161348,-0.07776773,-0.2471767,-0.2489087,-0.1694089,-0.171141,-0.001732026,-0.01947381,0.06027752,0.02743062,-0.1325999,0.09309307,-0.08839182,-0.2599924,-0.1927663,-0.1149986,0.05441036,0.05614238,0.07975134,0.04690443,-0.1131261,0.1125669,-0.068918,-0.2405186,-0.1732925,-0.09552476,0.07388417,0.0756162,-0.0328469,-0.1928774,0.03281555,-0.1486693,-0.32027,-0.2530438,-0.1752761,-0.005867167,-0.00413514,-0.1600305,0.06566245,-0.1158224,-0.2874231,-0.2201969,-0.1424292,0.02697974,0.02871176,0.225693,0.04420809,-0.1273925,-0.0601664,0.01760133,0.1870103,0.1887423,-0.1814849,-0.3530855,-0.2858594,-0.2080917,-0.03868272,-0.03695069,-0.1716006,-0.1043745,-0.02660676,0.1428022,0.1445342,0.06722614,0.1449939,0.3144028,0.3161348,0.07776773,0.2471767,0.2489087,0.1694089,0.171141,0.001732026

AT5G65700,BAM1,"Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.",NM_001203695,836699,3702.AT5G65700.1,"GO:0042742, GO:0050896",0.1003726,0.3887745,-0.3186754,0.4689824,-0.2405068,0.3491586,0.4320685,1.246584,0.5272341,0.1388878,0.4206463,0.2884018,-0.419048,0.3686098,-0.3408795,0.2487859,0.3316959,1.146211,0.4268614,0.03851516,0.3202736,-0.7074499,0.08020798,-0.6292813,-0.03961589,0.04329402,0.8578096,0.1384596,-0.2498867,0.0318718,0.7876578,0.07816855,0.667834,0.7507439,1.565259,0.8459095,0.4575632,0.7393217,-0.7094893,-0.1198239,-0.03691396,0.7776016,0.05825163,-0.3300947,-0.04833618,0.5896654,0.6725753,1.487091,0.7677409,0.3793946,0.6611531,0.08290991,0.8974255,0.1780755,-0.2102708,0.07148769,0.8145155,0.09516559,-0.2931807,-0.01142222,-0.71935,-1.107696,-0.8259378,-0.3883463,-0.1065878,0.2817585,-0.1003726,-0.3887745,0.3186754,-0.4689824,0.2405068,-0.3491586,-0.4320685,-1.246584,-0.5272341,-0.1388878,-0.4206463,-0.2884018,0.419048,-0.3686098,0.3408795,-0.2487859,-0.3316959,-1.146211,-0.4268614,-0.03851516,-0.3202736,0.7074499,-0.08020798,0.6292813,0.03961589,-0.04329402,-0.8578096,-0.1384596,0.2498867,-0.0318718,-0.7876578,-0.07816855,-0.667834,-0.7507439,-1.565259,-0.8459095,-0.4575632,-0.7393217,0.7094893,0.1198239,0.03691396,-0.7776016,-0.05825163,0.3300947,0.04833618,-0.5896654,-0.6725753,-1.487091,-0.7677409,-0.3793946,-0.6611531,-0.08290991,-0.8974255,-0.1780755,0.2102708,-0.07148769,-0.8145155,-0.09516559,0.2931807,0.01142222,0.71935,1.107696,0.8259378,0.3883463,0.1065878,-0.2817585
