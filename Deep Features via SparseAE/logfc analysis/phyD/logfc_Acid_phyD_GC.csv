"67","AT1G08370","ATDCP1","Encodes DCP1 involved in mRNA decapping.  DCP1 forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP2 (At5g13570) and VCS (VARICOSE) (At3g13300). However, unlike DCP2, DCP1 itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology. The protein was shown by immunoprecipitation not to interact with DCP2.","NM_100710",837357,"3702.AT1G08370.1","GO:0003676, GO:0003723, GO:0003729, GO:0003824, GO:0005488, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0006139, GO:0006401, GO:0006807, GO:0008152, GO:0009056, GO:0009987, GO:0016070, GO:0030234, GO:0030529, GO:0032991, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050790, GO:0065007, GO:0065009",-0.105325216,0.360428829,0.049434107,0.140621021,0.136557762,0.133584626,-0.04650317,0.34738743,0.186059259,0.221546511,0.189447114,0.465754044,0.154759323,0.245946237,0.241882978,0.238909841,0.058822045,0.452712646,0.291384474,0.326871727,0.294772329,-0.310994722,-0.219807807,-0.223871067,-0.226844203,-0.406931999,-0.013041399,-0.17436957,-0.138882317,-0.170981715,0.091186914,0.087123655,0.084150519,-0.095937278,0.297953323,0.136625152,0.172112404,0.140013006,-0.004063259,-0.007036396,-0.187124192,0.206766409,0.045438237,0.08092549,0.048826092,-0.002973136,-0.183060932,0.210829668,0.049501497,0.08498875,0.052889352,-0.180087796,0.213802804,0.052474633,0.087961886,0.055862488,0.3938906,0.232562429,0.268049682,0.235950284,-0.161328171,-0.125840919,-0.157940316,0.035487253,0.003387855,-0.032099398,0.105325216,-0.360428829,-0.049434107,-0.140621021,-0.136557762,-0.133584626,0.04650317,-0.34738743,-0.186059259,-0.221546511,-0.189447114,-0.465754044,-0.154759323,-0.245946237,-0.241882978,-0.238909841,-0.058822045,-0.452712646,-0.291384474,-0.326871727,-0.294772329,0.310994722,0.219807807,0.223871067,0.226844203,0.406931999,0.013041399,0.17436957,0.138882317,0.170981715,-0.091186914,-0.087123655,-0.084150519,0.095937278,-0.297953323,-0.136625152,-0.172112404,-0.140013006,0.004063259,0.007036396,0.187124192,-0.206766409,-0.045438237,-0.08092549,-0.048826092,0.002973136,0.183060932,-0.210829668,-0.049501497,-0.08498875,-0.052889352,0.180087796,-0.213802804,-0.052474633,-0.087961886,-0.055862488,-0.3938906,-0.232562429,-0.268049682,-0.235950284,0.161328171,0.125840919,0.157940316,-0.035487253,-0.003387855,0.032099398

"94","AT1G11310","ATMLO2","A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in  A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene,  jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin,  glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.","NM_001123796",837673,"3702.AT1G11310.1","GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",0.069210899,0.226387498,0.721979477,-0.045264959,0.317038643,0.111536685,0.477547171,0.059921629,0.152062933,0.289770355,0.741024722,0.157176598,0.652768578,-0.114475858,0.247827743,0.042325786,0.408336272,-0.00928927,0.082852034,0.220559456,0.671813822,0.49559198,-0.271652457,0.090651145,-0.114850812,0.251159674,-0.166465869,-0.074324564,0.063382857,0.514637224,-0.767244436,-0.404940835,-0.610442792,-0.244432306,-0.662057849,-0.569916544,-0.432209122,0.019045244,0.362303602,0.156801644,0.52281213,0.105186588,0.197327892,0.335035314,0.78628968,-0.205501957,0.160508529,-0.257117014,-0.164975709,-0.027268288,0.423986079,0.366010486,-0.051615057,0.040526248,0.17823367,0.629488036,-0.417625543,-0.325484238,-0.187776816,0.26347755,0.092141305,0.229848726,0.681103093,0.137707422,0.588961788,0.451254366,-0.069210899,-0.226387498,-0.721979477,0.045264959,-0.317038643,-0.111536685,-0.477547171,-0.059921629,-0.152062933,-0.289770355,-0.741024722,-0.157176598,-0.652768578,0.114475858,-0.247827743,-0.042325786,-0.408336272,0.00928927,-0.082852034,-0.220559456,-0.671813822,-0.49559198,0.271652457,-0.090651145,0.114850812,-0.251159674,0.166465869,0.074324564,-0.063382857,-0.514637224,0.767244436,0.404940835,0.610442792,0.244432306,0.662057849,0.569916544,0.432209122,-0.019045244,-0.362303602,-0.156801644,-0.52281213,-0.105186588,-0.197327892,-0.335035314,-0.78628968,0.205501957,-0.160508529,0.257117014,0.164975709,0.027268288,-0.423986079,-0.366010486,0.051615057,-0.040526248,-0.17823367,-0.629488036,0.417625543,0.325484238,0.187776816,-0.26347755,-0.092141305,-0.229848726,-0.681103093,-0.137707422,-0.588961788,-0.451254366

"96","AT1G11400","PYM","The PYM gene encodes a protein capable of interacting with MAGO, and Y14, whose orthologs form part of the exon junction complex in animal cells. In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together. But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times.

"148","AT1G15750","TPL","Encodes a protein with several WD40 repeats at the C-terminus and predicted protein-protein interaction domains at the N-terminus.  Together with the TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS (TPRs), it is thought to be involved in transcriptional repression of root-promoting genes in the top half of the embryo during the transition stage of embryogenesis.

"172","AT1G18450","ARP4","Encodes a gene similar to actin-related proteins in other organisms. Member of nuclear ARP family of genes. Component  of chromatin remodeling complexes, involved in chromatin-mediated gene regulation.  Phenotype of the arp4-1 mutant allele revealed partial sterility due to defects in anther development. Targeting the distinct, 3' UTR of AtARP4 transcripts with RNA interference caused a drastic reduction in the level of AtARP4 protein expression, and resulted in strong pleiotropic phenotypes such as altered organization of plant organs, early flowering, delayed flower senescence and high levels of sterility. Western blot analysis and immunolabelling demonstrated a clear correlation between reductions in the level of AtARP4 expression and severity of the phenotypes.","NM_101702",838425,"3702.AT1G18450.1",NA,0.132122144,0.052416577,-0.1040249,0.149220448,-0.079249047,0.079350881,0.250548615,-0.013411305,-0.054647185,-0.120009676,-0.312831997,-0.079705567,-0.236147044,0.017098304,-0.211371191,-0.052771263,0.118426471,-0.145533449,-0.186769329,-0.25213182,-0.444954141,-0.156441477,0.096803871,-0.131665624,0.026934304,0.198132038,-0.065827882,-0.107063762,-0.172426253,-0.365248574,0.253245348,0.024775853,0.183375781,0.354573515,0.090613595,0.049377715,-0.015984776,-0.208807097,-0.228469495,-0.069869567,0.101328167,-0.162631753,-0.203867633,-0.269230124,-0.462052445,0.158599928,0.329797662,0.065837743,0.024601862,-0.040760629,-0.23358295,0.171197734,-0.092762186,-0.133998066,-0.199360557,-0.392182878,-0.26395992,-0.3051958,-0.370558291,-0.563380612,-0.04123588,-0.106598371,-0.299420693,-0.065362491,-0.258184813,-0.192822321,-0.132122144,-0.052416577,0.1040249,-0.149220448,0.079249047,-0.079350881,-0.250548615,0.013411305,0.054647185,0.120009676,0.312831997,0.079705567,0.236147044,-0.017098304,0.211371191,0.052771263,-0.118426471,0.145533449,0.186769329,0.25213182,0.444954141,0.156441477,-0.096803871,0.131665624,-0.026934304,-0.198132038,0.065827882,0.107063762,0.172426253,0.365248574,-0.253245348,-0.024775853,-0.183375781,-0.354573515,-0.090613595,-0.049377715,0.015984776,0.208807097,0.228469495,0.069869567,-0.101328167,0.162631753,0.203867633,0.269230124,0.462052445,-0.158599928,-0.329797662,-0.065837743,-0.024601862,0.040760629,0.23358295,-0.171197734,0.092762186,0.133998066,0.199360557,0.392182878,0.26395992,0.3051958,0.370558291,0.563380612,0.04123588,0.106598371,0.299420693,0.065362491,0.258184813,0.192822321

"180","AT1G19180","AtJAZ1","JAZ1 is a nuclear-localized protein involved in jasmonate signaling. JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2.","NM_001332386",838501,NA,"GO:0000988, GO:0000989, GO:0003712, GO:0005488, GO:0005515, GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0006139, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0008152, GO:0009058, GO:0009719, GO:0009987, GO:0016070, GO:0019219, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0065007",-0.112477639,1.395459837,1.896732629,1.019884189,1.598027018,-0.013799353,1.433363586,1.06172748,1.554970615,0.453059323,2.457660071,1.507937476,2.009210268,1.132361828,1.710504657,0.098678286,1.545841225,1.17420512,1.667448254,0.565536962,2.57013771,0.501272791,-0.375575648,0.20256718,-1.40925919,0.037903748,-0.333732357,0.159510778,-0.942400514,1.062200234,-0.876848439,-0.298705611,-1.910531982,-0.463369043,-0.835005148,-0.341762014,-1.443673306,0.560927442,0.578142828,-1.033683542,0.413479397,0.041843291,0.535086426,-0.566824866,1.437775882,-1.611826371,-0.164663432,-0.536299537,-0.043056403,-1.144967695,0.859633053,1.447162939,1.075526834,1.568769968,0.466858676,2.471459424,-0.371636105,0.121607029,-0.980304263,1.024296485,0.493243134,-0.608668158,1.395932591,-1.101911292,0.902689456,2.004600748,0.112477639,-1.395459837,-1.896732629,-1.019884189,-1.598027018,0.013799353,-1.433363586,-1.06172748,-1.554970615,-0.453059323,-2.457660071,-1.507937476,-2.009210268,-1.132361828,-1.710504657,-0.098678286,-1.545841225,-1.17420512,-1.667448254,-0.565536962,-2.57013771,-0.501272791,0.375575648,-0.20256718,1.40925919,-0.037903748,0.333732357,-0.159510778,0.942400514,-1.062200234,0.876848439,0.298705611,1.910531982,0.463369043,0.835005148,0.341762014,1.443673306,-0.560927442,-0.578142828,1.033683542,-0.413479397,-0.041843291,-0.535086426,0.566824866,-1.437775882,1.611826371,0.164663432,0.536299537,0.043056403,1.144967695,-0.859633053,-1.447162939,-1.075526834,-1.568769968,-0.466858676,-2.471459424,0.371636105,-0.121607029,0.980304263,-1.024296485,-0.493243134,0.608668158,-1.395932591,1.101911292,-0.902689456,-2.004600748

"199","AT1G20450","ERD10","Encodes a gene induced by low temperature and dehydration. Inhibits e.coli growth while overexpressed. Belongs to the dehydrin protein family, which contains highly conserved stretches of 7-17 residues that are repetitively scattered in their sequences, the K-, S-, Y- and lysine rich segments. LTI29 and LTI30 double overexpressors confer cold tolerance.

The protein is localized to the nucleus, acts as a transcriptional repressor and is responsive to chitin oligomers. Also involved in response to photooxidative stress.","NM_102538",839666,"3702.AT1G27730.1","GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, NA",-0.42892415,1.252188903,4.414211264,1.502973751,3.488220324,-0.587483949,3.419965075,2.159588404,3.631588498,0.448345092,5.923984878,1.681113053,4.843135414,1.931897901,3.917144474,-0.1585598,3.848889225,2.588512554,4.060512647,0.877269241,6.352909027,3.162022361,0.250784848,2.236031421,-1.839672853,2.167776172,0.907399501,2.379399594,-0.803843812,4.671795974,-2.911237513,-0.92599094,-5.001695213,-0.994246189,-2.25462286,-0.782622766,-3.965866172,1.509773614,1.985246573,-2.0904577,1.916991324,0.656614653,2.128614747,-1.054628659,4.421011127,-4.075704273,-0.068255249,-1.32863192,0.143368174,-3.039875232,2.435764554,4.007449024,2.747072353,4.219072447,1.035829041,6.511468827,-1.260376671,0.211623423,-2.971619983,2.504019803,1.472000094,-1.711243312,3.764396474,-3.183243406,2.29239638,5.475639786,0.42892415,-1.252188903,-4.414211264,-1.502973751,-3.488220324,0.587483949,-3.419965075,-2.159588404,-3.631588498,-0.448345092,-5.923984878,-1.681113053,-4.843135414,-1.931897901,-3.917144474,0.1585598,-3.848889225,-2.588512554,-4.060512647,-0.877269241,-6.352909027,-3.162022361,-0.250784848,-2.236031421,1.839672853,-2.167776172,-0.907399501,-2.379399594,0.803843812,-4.671795974,2.911237513,0.92599094,5.001695213,0.994246189,2.25462286,0.782622766,3.965866172,-1.509773614,-1.985246573,2.0904577,-1.916991324,-0.656614653,-2.128614747,1.054628659,-4.421011127,4.075704273,0.068255249,1.32863192,-0.143368174,3.039875232,-2.435764554,-4.007449024,-2.747072353,-4.219072447,-1.035829041,-6.511468827,1.260376671,-0.211623423,2.971619983,-2.504019803,-1.472000094,1.711243312,-3.764396474,3.183243406,-2.29239638,-5.475639786

"261","AT1G29050","TBL38","Encodes a member of the TBL (TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE) gene family containing a plant-specific DUF231 (domain of unknown function) domain. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers.

"503","AT1G70660","MMZ2","MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.","NM_001198436",843403,"3702.AT1G70660.1","GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006464, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0019538, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-0.323634,-0.55392,-0.2827357,-0.588843,-0.5840769,-0.9986219,-0.3137059,-0.4144313,-0.2457743,-0.4927431,0.4421514,-0.230286,0.04089829,-0.265209,-0.2604429,-0.6749879,0.009928101,-0.09079732,0.07785974,-0.1691091,0.7657854,0.2711842,-0.034923,-0.03015693,-0.444702,0.2402141,0.1394886,0.3081457,0.06117684,0.9960713,-0.3061072,-0.3013412,-0.7158862,-0.03097019,-0.1316956,0.03696145,-0.2100074,0.7248871,0.004766069,-0.409779,0.2751371,0.1744116,0.3430687,0.09609983,1.030994,-0.414545,0.270371,0.1696456,0.3383026,0.09133377,1.026228,0.684916,0.5841906,0.7528477,0.5058788,1.440773,-0.1007254,0.06793164,-0.1790372,0.7558573,0.1686571,-0.0783118,0.8565827,-0.2469689,0.6879256,0.9348945,0.323634,0.55392,0.2827357,0.588843,0.5840769,0.9986219,0.3137059,0.4144313,0.2457743,0.4927431,-0.4421514,0.230286,-0.04089829,0.265209,0.2604429,0.6749879,-0.009928101,0.09079732,-0.07785974,0.1691091,-0.7657854,-0.2711842,0.034923,0.03015693,0.444702,-0.2402141,-0.1394886,-0.3081457,-0.06117684,-0.9960713,0.3061072,0.3013412,0.7158862,0.03097019,0.1316956,-0.03696145,0.2100074,-0.7248871,-0.004766069,0.409779,-0.2751371,-0.1744116,-0.3430687,-0.09609983,-1.030994,0.414545,-0.270371,-0.1696456,-0.3383026,-0.09133377,-1.026228,-0.684916,-0.5841906,-0.7528477,-0.5058788,-1.440773,0.1007254,-0.06793164,0.1790372,-0.7558573,-0.1686571,0.0783118,-0.8565827,0.2469689,-0.6879256,-0.9348945

The C-terminal portion of the protein can also specifically interact with two members of the Rab family of GTPases (RabH1b and RabH1c).","NM_001124150",844322,"3702.AT1G79830.4","GO:0000910, GO:0003774, GO:0005198, GO:0005200, GO:0005488, GO:0005515, GO:0005622, GO:0005856, GO:0005886, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006928, GO:0007049, GO:0007067, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0015629, GO:0016043, GO:0016192, GO:0030054, GO:0030234, GO:0032502, GO:0032989, GO:0035556, GO:0003824, GO:0008152, GO:0016020, GO:0016462, GO:0016787, GO:0044464, GO:0050790, GO:0051179, GO:0065007, GO:0065009",-0.02422416,0.1009172,-0.06463305,-0.03948344,-0.02796465,-0.09105443,0.07202283,-0.04739763,-0.1611651,-0.000588578,0.05050528,0.1251414,-0.04040889,-0.01525928,-0.003740483,-0.06683027,0.096247,-0.02317346,-0.136941,0.02363559,0.07472944,-0.1655503,-0.1404007,-0.1288819,-0.1919717,-0.02889439,-0.1483149,-0.2620824,-0.1015058,-0.05041194,0.02514961,0.0366684,-0.02642138,0.1366559,0.01723542,-0.09653208,0.06404447,0.1151383,0.01151879,-0.05157099,0.1115063,-0.007914186,-0.1216817,0.03889486,0.08998872,-0.06308978,0.09998748,-0.01943298,-0.1332005,0.02737607,0.07846993,0.1630773,0.0436568,-0.0701107,0.09046585,0.1415597,-0.1194205,-0.233188,-0.07261141,-0.02151755,-0.1137675,0.04680905,0.09790291,0.1605765,0.2116704,0.05109386,0.02422416,-0.1009172,0.06463305,0.03948344,0.02796465,0.09105443,-0.07202283,0.04739763,0.1611651,0.000588578,-0.05050528,-0.1251414,0.04040889,0.01525928,0.003740483,0.06683027,-0.096247,0.02317346,0.136941,-0.02363559,-0.07472944,0.1655503,0.1404007,0.1288819,0.1919717,0.02889439,0.1483149,0.2620824,0.1015058,0.05041194,-0.02514961,-0.0366684,0.02642138,-0.1366559,-0.01723542,0.09653208,-0.06404447,-0.1151383,-0.01151879,0.05157099,-0.1115063,0.007914186,0.1216817,-0.03889486,-0.08998872,0.06308978,-0.09998748,0.01943298,0.1332005,-0.02737607,-0.07846993,-0.1630773,-0.0436568,0.0701107,-0.09046585,-0.1415597,0.1194205,0.233188,0.07261141,0.02151755,0.1137675,-0.04680905,-0.09790291,-0.1605765,-0.2116704,-0.05109386

"618","AT2G01570","RGA","Member of the VHIID/DELLA regulatory family. Contains homopolymeric serine and threonine residues, a putative nuclear localization signal, leucine heptad repeats, and an LXXLL motif. Putative transcriptional regulator repressing the gibberellin response and integration of phytohormone signalling. DELLAs repress cell proliferation and expansion that drives plant growth. The protein undergoes degradation in response to GA via the 26S proteasome. RGA1 binds to PIF3 and  inhibits its DNA binding activity and thus affects the expression of PIF3 regulated genes.

Expression is induced in response to salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate and bacterial pathogens.","NM_126423",814903,NA,"GO:0003824, GO:0006790, GO:0008152, GO:0016740",0.1186431,0.6051076,0.7355721,0.4093597,0.2280444,0.6328412,-0.4081042,0.8076924,1.260201,1.164809,0.2441137,0.4864644,0.6169289,0.2907165,0.1094013,0.514198,-0.5267473,0.6890493,1.141558,1.046166,0.1254706,0.1304645,-0.1957479,-0.3770632,0.0277336,-1.013212,0.2025848,0.6550931,0.5597014,-0.3609938,-0.3262124,-0.5075276,-0.1027309,-1.143676,0.07212035,0.5246286,0.4292369,-0.4914583,-0.1813152,0.2234815,-0.8174639,0.3983328,0.8508411,0.7554493,-0.1652459,0.4047967,-0.6361486,0.579648,1.032156,0.9367646,0.01606931,-1.040945,0.1748512,0.6273595,0.5319678,-0.3887274,1.215797,1.668305,1.572913,0.6522179,0.4525083,0.3571166,-0.5635787,-0.09539173,-1.016087,-0.9206952,-0.1186431,-0.6051076,-0.7355721,-0.4093597,-0.2280444,-0.6328412,0.4081042,-0.8076924,-1.260201,-1.164809,-0.2441137,-0.4864644,-0.6169289,-0.2907165,-0.1094013,-0.514198,0.5267473,-0.6890493,-1.141558,-1.046166,-0.1254706,-0.1304645,0.1957479,0.3770632,-0.0277336,1.013212,-0.2025848,-0.6550931,-0.5597014,0.3609938,0.3262124,0.5075276,0.1027309,1.143676,-0.07212035,-0.5246286,-0.4292369,0.4914583,0.1813152,-0.2234815,0.8174639,-0.3983328,-0.8508411,-0.7554493,0.1652459,-0.4047967,0.6361486,-0.579648,-1.032156,-0.9367646,-0.01606931,1.040945,-0.1748512,-0.6273595,-0.5319678,0.3887274,-1.215797,-1.668305,-1.572913,-0.6522179,-0.4525083,-0.3571166,0.5635787,0.09539173,1.016087,0.9206952

"645","AT2G05710","ACO3","Encodes an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of citrate to isocitrate through a cis-aconitate intermediate, indicating that it may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways. The protein is believed to accumulate in the mitochondria and the cytosol. It affects CSD2 (At2g28190 - a superoxide dismutase) transcript levels and may play a role in the response to oxidative stress.

"679","AT2G17290","ATCDPK3","Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.

It specifically regulates FRO2 at the level of mRNA accumulation and IRT1 at the level of protein accumulation.Similar to FER in tomato and is a regulator of iron uptake.","NM_001336147",817362,"3702.AT2G28160.1",NA,-0.1545897,-0.09857687,-0.02264772,-0.8070075,-0.5789586,-1.088762,-0.7143866,-0.5236036,-0.5690817,-0.3146389,0.3607642,0.05601281,0.131942,-0.6524178,-0.424369,-0.9341726,-0.5597969,-0.369014,-0.414492,-0.1600493,0.5153538,0.07592915,-0.7084306,-0.4803818,-0.9901854,-0.6158097,-0.4250268,-0.4705049,-0.2160621,0.459341,-0.7843597,-0.5563109,-1.066115,-0.6917389,-0.5009559,-0.546434,-0.2919912,0.3834119,0.2280488,-0.2817548,0.09262085,0.2834038,0.2379257,0.4923685,1.167772,-0.5098036,-0.135428,0.055355,0.009876909,0.2643197,0.9397228,0.3743756,0.5651586,0.5196805,0.7741233,1.449526,0.190783,0.1453049,0.3997477,1.075151,-0.04547809,0.2089647,0.8843678,0.2544428,0.9298459,0.6754031,0.1545897,0.09857687,0.02264772,0.8070075,0.5789586,1.088762,0.7143866,0.5236036,0.5690817,0.3146389,-0.3607642,-0.05601281,-0.131942,0.6524178,0.424369,0.9341726,0.5597969,0.369014,0.414492,0.1600493,-0.5153538,-0.07592915,0.7084306,0.4803818,0.9901854,0.6158097,0.4250268,0.4705049,0.2160621,-0.459341,0.7843597,0.5563109,1.066115,0.6917389,0.5009559,0.546434,0.2919912,-0.3834119,-0.2280488,0.2817548,-0.09262085,-0.2834038,-0.2379257,-0.4923685,-1.167772,0.5098036,0.135428,-0.055355,-0.009876909,-0.2643197,-0.9397228,-0.3743756,-0.5651586,-0.5196805,-0.7741233,-1.449526,-0.190783,-0.1453049,-0.3997477,-1.075151,0.04547809,-0.2089647,-0.8843678,-0.2544428,-0.9298459,-0.6754031
"777","AT2G28290","CHR3","Encodes a SWI2/SNF2-like protein in the SNF2 subclass. Homozygous plants with null mutations exhibit premature termination of the meristem and carpelloid structures from the inflorescence meristem. Co-activator of floral  homeotic gene expression. Acts with LFY to regulate shoot apical meristem identity. Required for meristem maintenance. Regulates  flowering under a non-inductive photoperiod. It promotes the expression of CUC2 during cotyledon boundary formation.  Affects reproductive shoot apical meristem function by regulating the expression of WUS. In CHiP experiments SYD binds to WUS promoter. Present as two forms in the nucleus, full-length and truncated, with the latter apparently lacking the C-terminal domain. The ratio of the two forms  differs in juvenile and in adult tissues. The C-terminal domain is not required for activity.","NM_001084502",817375,"3702.AT2G28290.1",NA,-0.02198224,0.2550683,-0.5148878,-0.2252793,-0.5438691,-0.487048,-0.3200376,0.1043891,-0.5811772,-0.3580337,-0.6301459,0.2770505,-0.4929056,-0.2032971,-0.5218868,-0.4650657,-0.2980553,0.1263714,-0.559195,-0.3360515,-0.6081637,-0.7699561,-0.4803476,-0.7989373,-0.7421162,-0.5751058,-0.1506791,-0.8362455,-0.6131019,-0.8852141,0.2896085,-0.02898127,0.02783985,0.1948503,0.6192769,-0.06628939,0.1568541,-0.1152581,-0.3185897,-0.2617686,-0.09475821,0.3296685,-0.3558979,-0.1327544,-0.4048666,0.05682112,0.2238315,0.6482582,-0.03730812,0.1858354,-0.08627681,0.1670104,0.5914371,-0.09412924,0.1290143,-0.1430979,0.4244267,-0.2611397,-0.03799614,-0.3101083,-0.6855663,-0.4624228,-0.734535,0.2231435,-0.04896869,-0.2721122,0.02198224,-0.2550683,0.5148878,0.2252793,0.5438691,0.487048,0.3200376,-0.1043891,0.5811772,0.3580337,0.6301459,-0.2770505,0.4929056,0.2032971,0.5218868,0.4650657,0.2980553,-0.1263714,0.559195,0.3360515,0.6081637,0.7699561,0.4803476,0.7989373,0.7421162,0.5751058,0.1506791,0.8362455,0.6131019,0.8852141,-0.2896085,0.02898127,-0.02783985,-0.1948503,-0.6192769,0.06628939,-0.1568541,0.1152581,0.3185897,0.2617686,0.09475821,-0.3296685,0.3558979,0.1327544,0.4048666,-0.05682112,-0.2238315,-0.6482582,0.03730812,-0.1858354,0.08627681,-0.1670104,-0.5914371,0.09412924,-0.1290143,0.1430979,-0.4244267,0.2611397,0.03799614,0.3101083,0.6855663,0.4624228,0.734535,-0.2231435,0.04896869,0.2721122

"856","AT2G36910","ABCB1","Belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Also known as AtMDR1.Possibly regulates auxin-dependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin transport in the root.  Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AT3G28860.  PGP1 mediates cellular efflux of IAA and interacts with PIN genes that may confer an accelerated vectoral component to PGP-mediated transport.

JAR1 catalyzes the formation of a biologically active jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate. JA-Ile promotes the interaction between JAZ1 and COI1 in the jasmonate signaling pathway. JAR1 localizes to the cytoplasm and is also a phytochrome A signaling component. JAR1 is an auxin-induced gene. Loss of function mutants are defective in a variety of responses to jasmonic acid. JAR1 has additional enzymatic activities in vitro, (e.g. the ability to synthesize adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate and other JA conjugates), but there are no data to show whether JAR1 catalyzes many of these reactions in vivo.

"1066","AT3G08730","ATPK1","Encodes a protein-serine kinase that phosphorylates ribosomal protein in vitro. Activation of AtS6k is regulated by 1-naphthylacetic acid and kinetin, at least in part, via a lipid kinase-dependent pathway. Involved in translational up-regulation of ribosomal proteins. Phosphorylated by PDK1. Interacts with RAPTOR1, which in turn interacts with TOR. SPK6 activity is affected by osmotic stress, and plants overexpressing S6k1 are hypersensitive to osmotic stress.  The gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level detected in metabolically active tissues.","NM_001337768",820020,"3702.AT3G08730.1","GO:0003824, GO:0004672, GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0005737, GO:0006464, GO:0006468, GO:0006796, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016301, GO:0016740, GO:0019538, GO:0035556, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0065007, NA",0.004851044,0.2994907,-0.0368612,0.009915942,0.07914063,-0.04393488,-0.2090708,0.2894773,0.08563859,0.1107846,0.2403998,0.2946397,-0.04171225,0.005064897,0.07428958,-0.04878593,-0.2139219,0.2846263,0.08078755,0.1059336,0.2355487,-0.3363519,-0.2895748,-0.2203501,-0.3434256,-0.5085615,-0.01001341,-0.2138521,-0.1887061,-0.05909095,0.04677714,0.1160018,-0.007073683,-0.1722096,0.3263385,0.1224998,0.1476458,0.277261,0.06922468,-0.05385083,-0.2189868,0.2795614,0.07572265,0.1008687,0.2304838,-0.1230755,-0.2882115,0.2103367,0.006497966,0.03164398,0.1612591,-0.1651359,0.3334122,0.1295735,0.1547195,0.2843346,0.4985481,0.2947094,0.3198554,0.4494706,-0.2038387,-0.1786927,-0.04907754,0.02514602,0.1547612,0.1296152,-0.004851044,-0.2994907,0.0368612,-0.009915942,-0.07914063,0.04393488,0.2090708,-0.2894773,-0.08563859,-0.1107846,-0.2403998,-0.2946397,0.04171225,-0.005064897,-0.07428958,0.04878593,0.2139219,-0.2846263,-0.08078755,-0.1059336,-0.2355487,0.3363519,0.2895748,0.2203501,0.3434256,0.5085615,0.01001341,0.2138521,0.1887061,0.05909095,-0.04677714,-0.1160018,0.007073683,0.1722096,-0.3263385,-0.1224998,-0.1476458,-0.277261,-0.06922468,0.05385083,0.2189868,-0.2795614,-0.07572265,-0.1008687,-0.2304838,0.1230755,0.2882115,-0.2103367,-0.006497966,-0.03164398,-0.1612591,0.1651359,-0.3334122,-0.1295735,-0.1547195,-0.2843346,-0.4985481,-0.2947094,-0.3198554,-0.4494706,0.2038387,0.1786927,0.04907754,-0.02514602,-0.1547612,-0.1296152

"1109","AT3G13300","VCS","Encodes VCS (VARICOSE).   Involved in mRNA decapping.  VCS forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP1 (At1g08370) and DCP2 (At5g13570).  Unlike DCP2, VCS itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology.  VCS is also required for leaf development.","NM_001338042",820530,"3702.AT3G13300.1","GO:0043234, GO:0032991",-0.2656067,-0.01113253,-0.6076452,-0.1684457,-0.6263343,-0.4776748,-0.2940127,-0.1851066,-0.6799987,-0.1752185,-0.4629881,0.2544742,-0.3420385,0.097161,-0.3607276,-0.2120681,-0.02840599,0.08050013,-0.414392,0.09038815,-0.1973814,-0.5965126,-0.1573132,-0.6152018,-0.4665423,-0.2828802,-0.173974,-0.6688662,-0.164086,-0.4518556,0.4391995,-0.01868915,0.1299703,0.3136325,0.4225386,-0.07235353,0.4324266,0.1446571,-0.4578886,-0.3092291,-0.125567,-0.01666088,-0.511553,-0.00677285,-0.2945424,0.1486595,0.3323216,0.4412277,-0.05366437,0.4511158,0.1633462,0.1836621,0.2925682,-0.2023239,0.3024563,0.01468673,0.1089061,-0.385986,0.1187941,-0.1689754,-0.4948921,0.009888026,-0.2778815,0.5047801,0.2170106,-0.2877695,0.2656067,0.01113253,0.6076452,0.1684457,0.6263343,0.4776748,0.2940127,0.1851066,0.6799987,0.1752185,0.4629881,-0.2544742,0.3420385,-0.097161,0.3607276,0.2120681,0.02840599,-0.08050013,0.414392,-0.09038815,0.1973814,0.5965126,0.1573132,0.6152018,0.4665423,0.2828802,0.173974,0.6688662,0.164086,0.4518556,-0.4391995,0.01868915,-0.1299703,-0.3136325,-0.4225386,0.07235353,-0.4324266,-0.1446571,0.4578886,0.3092291,0.125567,0.01666088,0.511553,0.00677285,0.2945424,-0.1486595,-0.3323216,-0.4412277,0.05366437,-0.4511158,-0.1633462,-0.1836621,-0.2925682,0.2023239,-0.3024563,-0.01468673,-0.1089061,0.385986,-0.1187941,0.1689754,0.4948921,-0.009888026,0.2778815,-0.5047801,-0.2170106,0.2877695

Consists of a single exon and is characterized by a conserved C-terminal motif and N-terminal signal peptide.  RALF23 is significantly downregulated by brassinolide treatment of seedlings.

Aggregation of NIT1 in cells directly abutting wound sites is one of the earliest events associated with wound and herbicide-induced cell death.  The protein undergoes thiolation following treatment with the  oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide. It is also involved in the conversion of IAN to IAM (indole-3-acetamide) and other non-auxin-related metabolic processes.","NM_001084765",823556,"3702.AT3G44310.1","GO:0003824, GO:0008152, GO:0016787",0.3472985,-0.02404181,1.349117,0.06623771,0.5884981,0.2932968,1.069331,0.4332792,1.412861,0.03739078,1.228266,-0.3713403,1.001818,-0.2810607,0.2411996,-0.05400161,0.7220329,0.08598076,1.065563,-0.3099077,0.880968,1.373159,0.09027952,0.6125399,0.3173387,1.093373,0.457321,1.436903,0.06143259,1.252308,-1.282879,-0.7606188,-1.05582,-0.2797855,-0.9158377,0.0637441,-1.311726,-0.1208505,0.5222604,0.2270591,1.003094,0.3670415,1.346623,-0.02884693,1.162029,-0.2952012,0.4808333,-0.1552189,0.8243629,-0.5511073,0.6397683,0.7760346,0.1399824,1.119564,-0.2559061,0.9349696,-0.6360522,0.3435296,-1.031941,0.158935,0.9795818,-0.3958884,0.7949872,-1.37547,-0.1845946,1.190876,-0.3472985,0.02404181,-1.349117,-0.06623771,-0.5884981,-0.2932968,-1.069331,-0.4332792,-1.412861,-0.03739078,-1.228266,0.3713403,-1.001818,0.2810607,-0.2411996,0.05400161,-0.7220329,-0.08598076,-1.065563,0.3099077,-0.880968,-1.373159,-0.09027952,-0.6125399,-0.3173387,-1.093373,-0.457321,-1.436903,-0.06143259,-1.252308,1.282879,0.7606188,1.05582,0.2797855,0.9158377,-0.0637441,1.311726,0.1208505,-0.5222604,-0.2270591,-1.003094,-0.3670415,-1.346623,0.02884693,-1.162029,0.2952012,-0.4808333,0.1552189,-0.8243629,0.5511073,-0.6397683,-0.7760346,-0.1399824,-1.119564,0.2559061,-0.9349696,0.6360522,-0.3435296,1.031941,-0.158935,-0.9795818,0.3958884,-0.7949872,1.37547,0.1845946,-1.190876

"1329","AT3G51840","ACX4","Encodes a short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, which catalyzes the first step of peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation during early, post-germinative growth in oilseed species. Null mutants virtually lack short-chain acyl-CoA and are resistant to 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid, which is converted to the herbicide and auxin analogue 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by beta-oxidation. Despite the almost complete loss of short-chain activity, lipid catabolism and seedling growth and establishment was unaltered in the acx4 mutant. However, double mutants in acx3acx4 (acx3 encodes medium chain acyl CoA oxidase) were not viable and arrested during embryogenesis.","NM_115043",824347,"3702.AT3G51840.1","GO:0000166, GO:0003824, GO:0005488, GO:0006629, GO:0006631, GO:0006635, GO:0008152, GO:0009056, GO:0009987, GO:0016491, GO:0042592, GO:0044238, GO:0065007",0.4102949,0.2253079,0.5602371,-0.4198601,0.3191252,-0.2501013,0.825358,0.09149839,0.6377515,0.1197427,0.9024246,-0.1849869,0.1499423,-0.830155,-0.0911697,-0.6603962,0.4150632,-0.3187965,0.2274567,-0.2905522,0.4921297,0.3349292,-0.6451681,0.09381723,-0.4754093,0.6000501,-0.1338095,0.4124436,-0.1055653,0.6771166,-0.9800973,-0.241112,-0.8103384,0.2651209,-0.4687387,0.07751441,-0.4404944,0.3421875,0.7389853,0.1697588,1.245218,0.5113585,1.057612,0.5396028,1.322285,-0.5692265,0.5062329,-0.2276268,0.3186264,-0.1993825,0.5832994,1.075459,0.3415997,0.8878529,0.369844,1.152526,-0.7338596,-0.1876065,-0.7056154,0.07706655,0.5462531,0.02824427,0.8109262,-0.5180089,0.264673,0.7826819,-0.4102949,-0.2253079,-0.5602371,0.4198601,-0.3191252,0.2501013,-0.825358,-0.09149839,-0.6377515,-0.1197427,-0.9024246,0.1849869,-0.1499423,0.830155,0.0911697,0.6603962,-0.4150632,0.3187965,-0.2274567,0.2905522,-0.4921297,-0.3349292,0.6451681,-0.09381723,0.4754093,-0.6000501,0.1338095,-0.4124436,0.1055653,-0.6771166,0.9800973,0.241112,0.8103384,-0.2651209,0.4687387,-0.07751441,0.4404944,-0.3421875,-0.7389853,-0.1697588,-1.245218,-0.5113585,-1.057612,-0.5396028,-1.322285,0.5692265,-0.5062329,0.2276268,-0.3186264,0.1993825,-0.5832994,-1.075459,-0.3415997,-0.8878529,-0.369844,-1.152526,0.7338596,0.1876065,0.7056154,-0.07706655,-0.5462531,-0.02824427,-0.8109262,0.5180089,-0.264673,-0.7826819

A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).","NM_115286",824593,"3702.AT3G54260.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005794, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016407, GO:0016740, GO:0016746, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",-0.06610463,-0.3831103,-0.6700707,0.2194088,-0.8334558,-0.2150826,0.04802585,0.4945537,0.3531847,0.1448537,0.3548412,-0.3170057,-0.6039661,0.2855135,-0.7673512,-0.148978,0.1141305,0.5606583,0.4192894,0.2109584,0.4209459,-0.2869604,0.6025191,-0.4503455,0.1680277,0.4311362,0.877664,0.736295,0.527964,0.7379515,0.8894796,-0.1633851,0.4549881,0.7180966,1.164624,1.023255,0.8149245,1.024912,-1.052865,-0.4344914,-0.171383,0.2751448,0.1337759,-0.07455509,0.1354324,0.6183732,0.8814817,1.328009,1.186641,0.9783095,1.188297,0.2631085,0.7096363,0.5682673,0.3599363,0.5699238,0.4465278,0.3051589,0.09682788,0.3068154,-0.1413689,-0.3496999,-0.1397124,-0.208331,0.001656505,0.2099875,0.06610463,0.3831103,0.6700707,-0.2194088,0.8334558,0.2150826,-0.04802585,-0.4945537,-0.3531847,-0.1448537,-0.3548412,0.3170057,0.6039661,-0.2855135,0.7673512,0.148978,-0.1141305,-0.5606583,-0.4192894,-0.2109584,-0.4209459,0.2869604,-0.6025191,0.4503455,-0.1680277,-0.4311362,-0.877664,-0.736295,-0.527964,-0.7379515,-0.8894796,0.1633851,-0.4549881,-0.7180966,-1.164624,-1.023255,-0.8149245,-1.024912,1.052865,0.4344914,0.171383,-0.2751448,-0.1337759,0.07455509,-0.1354324,-0.6183732,-0.8814817,-1.328009,-1.186641,-0.9783095,-1.188297,-0.2631085,-0.7096363,-0.5682673,-0.3599363,-0.5699238,-0.4465278,-0.3051589,-0.09682788,-0.3068154,0.1413689,0.3496999,0.1397124,0.208331,-0.001656505,-0.2099875

"1376","AT3G55360","ATTSC13","Enoyl-CoA reductase is involved in all very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) elongation reactions that are required for cuticular wax, storage lipid and sphingolipid metabolism. The protein is located in the ER, but in contrast to its yeast homolog TSC13 is not particularly enriched in the nuclear envelope-vacuole junction. Mutants in this gene show abnormal organ morphology and stem glossiness. Cells in all tissues are only about 1/3 of the size of wild type cells. The morphological changes are most likely to result from the reduction in the VLCFA content of sphingolipids. Mutants also show abnormalities in the endocytic membrane organization and transport.","NM_115394",824702,"3702.AT3G55360.1","GO:0003824, GO:0016491, NA",-0.2159459,0.1746326,-0.02675818,0.143615,-0.08044097,0.2132994,-0.1726232,-0.2215353,-0.1953661,-0.07007472,-0.3407712,0.3905786,0.1891878,0.359561,0.135505,0.4292453,0.04332274,-0.005589316,0.02057982,0.1458712,-0.1248253,-0.2013908,-0.03101764,-0.2550736,0.03866675,-0.3472559,-0.3961679,-0.3699988,-0.2447074,-0.5154039,0.1703732,-0.05368279,0.2400576,-0.145865,-0.1947771,-0.1686079,-0.04331653,-0.314013,-0.224056,0.06968438,-0.3162382,-0.3651503,-0.3389811,-0.2136897,-0.4843862,0.2937404,-0.09218224,-0.1410943,-0.1149252,0.01036626,-0.2603302,-0.3859226,-0.4348347,-0.4086655,-0.2833741,-0.5540706,-0.04891205,-0.02274292,0.1025485,-0.168148,0.02616914,0.1514605,-0.1192359,0.1252914,-0.1454051,-0.2706965,0.2159459,-0.1746326,0.02675818,-0.143615,0.08044097,-0.2132994,0.1726232,0.2215353,0.1953661,0.07007472,0.3407712,-0.3905786,-0.1891878,-0.359561,-0.135505,-0.4292453,-0.04332274,0.005589316,-0.02057982,-0.1458712,0.1248253,0.2013908,0.03101764,0.2550736,-0.03866675,0.3472559,0.3961679,0.3699988,0.2447074,0.5154039,-0.1703732,0.05368279,-0.2400576,0.145865,0.1947771,0.1686079,0.04331653,0.314013,0.224056,-0.06968438,0.3162382,0.3651503,0.3389811,0.2136897,0.4843862,-0.2937404,0.09218224,0.1410943,0.1149252,-0.01036626,0.2603302,0.3859226,0.4348347,0.4086655,0.2833741,0.5540706,0.04891205,0.02274292,-0.1025485,0.168148,-0.02616914,-0.1514605,0.1192359,-0.1252914,0.1454051,0.2706965

As part of the SCF complex and in the presence of auxin, TIR1 interacts with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins and mediates their degradation.","NM_116163",825473,NA,NA,-0.01203019,0.1908526,-0.2898643,0.4176658,-0.1022371,0.1064301,0.4780636,0.3943581,0.1779143,0.2744852,0.1181508,0.2028828,-0.2778341,0.429696,-0.09020686,0.1184603,0.4900938,0.4063883,0.1899445,0.2865154,0.130181,-0.4807169,0.2268132,-0.2930896,-0.08442246,0.2872111,0.2035056,-0.0129383,0.0836326,-0.07270172,0.7075301,0.1876273,0.3962944,0.767928,0.6842225,0.4677786,0.5643495,0.4080152,-0.5199028,-0.3112357,0.06039788,-0.02330763,-0.2397515,-0.1431806,-0.2995149,0.2086672,0.5803007,0.4965952,0.2801513,0.3767222,0.2203879,0.3716335,0.287928,0.07148416,0.1680551,0.01172074,-0.08370551,-0.3001494,-0.2035785,-0.3599128,-0.2164439,-0.119873,-0.2762073,0.0965709,-0.05976342,-0.1563343,0.01203019,-0.1908526,0.2898643,-0.4176658,0.1022371,-0.1064301,-0.4780636,-0.3943581,-0.1779143,-0.2744852,-0.1181508,-0.2028828,0.2778341,-0.429696,0.09020686,-0.1184603,-0.4900938,-0.4063883,-0.1899445,-0.2865154,-0.130181,0.4807169,-0.2268132,0.2930896,0.08442246,-0.2872111,-0.2035056,0.0129383,-0.0836326,0.07270172,-0.7075301,-0.1876273,-0.3962944,-0.767928,-0.6842225,-0.4677786,-0.5643495,-0.4080152,0.5199028,0.3112357,-0.06039788,0.02330763,0.2397515,0.1431806,0.2995149,-0.2086672,-0.5803007,-0.4965952,-0.2801513,-0.3767222,-0.2203879,-0.3716335,-0.287928,-0.07148416,-0.1680551,-0.01172074,0.08370551,0.3001494,0.2035785,0.3599128,0.2164439,0.119873,0.2762073,-0.0965709,0.05976342,0.1563343

This cytoplasmic protein does not directly interact with a viral movement protein (MP), but, it does promote the movement of NSP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of NIG in Arabidopsis plants renders them more sensitive to geminivirus infection.","NM_117409",826966,"3702.AT4G13350.1","GO:0003676, GO:0005083, GO:0005488, GO:0005515, GO:0009987, GO:0030234, GO:0003824, GO:0008152, GO:0050790, GO:0065007, GO:0065009",0.126505,0.2904175,-0.1114314,0.1621433,-0.2091375,0.1152467,-0.0733921,0.9148948,0.606567,0.5340195,0.5632392,0.1639125,-0.2379364,0.03563834,-0.3356424,-0.01125833,-0.1998971,0.7883898,0.480062,0.4075145,0.4367343,-0.401849,-0.1282742,-0.499555,-0.1751709,-0.3638096,0.6244773,0.3161494,0.243602,0.2728217,0.2735747,-0.09770604,0.2266781,0.03803932,1.026326,0.7179984,0.6454509,0.6746707,-0.3712808,-0.04689667,-0.2355354,0.7527515,0.4444237,0.3718762,0.4010959,0.3243841,0.1357454,1.124032,0.8157044,0.743157,0.7723767,-0.1886388,0.7996481,0.4913203,0.4187729,0.4479926,0.9882869,0.6799591,0.6074116,0.6366313,-0.3083278,-0.3808753,-0.3516555,-0.07254745,-0.04332774,0.02921972,-0.126505,-0.2904175,0.1114314,-0.1621433,0.2091375,-0.1152467,0.0733921,-0.9148948,-0.606567,-0.5340195,-0.5632392,-0.1639125,0.2379364,-0.03563834,0.3356424,0.01125833,0.1998971,-0.7883898,-0.480062,-0.4075145,-0.4367343,0.401849,0.1282742,0.499555,0.1751709,0.3638096,-0.6244773,-0.3161494,-0.243602,-0.2728217,-0.2735747,0.09770604,-0.2266781,-0.03803932,-1.026326,-0.7179984,-0.6454509,-0.6746707,0.3712808,0.04689667,0.2355354,-0.7527515,-0.4444237,-0.3718762,-0.4010959,-0.3243841,-0.1357454,-1.124032,-0.8157044,-0.743157,-0.7723767,0.1886388,-0.7996481,-0.4913203,-0.4187729,-0.4479926,-0.9882869,-0.6799591,-0.6074116,-0.6366313,0.3083278,0.3808753,0.3516555,0.07254745,0.04332774,-0.02921972

"1656","AT4G26970","ACO2","Encodes an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of citrate to isocitrate through a cis-aconitate intermediate, indicating that it may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways.

Overexpression causes phenotypes similar to GA-deficient plants and these plants show reduced levels of GA due to lower expression levels of AtGA20ox1, AtGA3ox3 and AtGA3ox1.","NM_119637",829623,"3702.AT4G34710.1","GO:0003824, GO:0006520, GO:0006807, GO:0008152, GO:0009058, GO:0009987, GO:0016829, GO:0016831, GO:0044238",0.03441744,1.089146,0.6047662,0.1853591,0.3597386,0.9504163,-0.05721481,1.941363,0.9866579,1.332009,0.626507,1.054728,0.5703488,0.1509416,0.3253212,0.9159988,-0.09163225,1.906945,0.9522405,1.297592,0.5920896,-0.4843794,-0.9037866,-0.729407,-0.1387294,-1.14636,0.8522169,-0.1024878,0.2428634,-0.4626387,-0.4194071,-0.2450276,0.34565,-0.661981,1.336596,0.3818917,0.7272429,0.02174077,0.1743796,0.7650572,-0.2425739,1.756004,0.8012988,1.14665,0.4411479,0.5906776,-0.4169534,1.581624,0.6269193,0.9722705,0.2667684,-1.007631,0.9909463,0.03624162,0.3815928,-0.3239093,1.998577,1.043873,1.389224,0.6837218,-0.9547047,-0.6093535,-1.314856,0.3453512,-0.3601509,-0.7055021,-0.03441744,-1.089146,-0.6047662,-0.1853591,-0.3597386,-0.9504163,0.05721481,-1.941363,-0.9866579,-1.332009,-0.626507,-1.054728,-0.5703488,-0.1509416,-0.3253212,-0.9159988,0.09163225,-1.906945,-0.9522405,-1.297592,-0.5920896,0.4843794,0.9037866,0.729407,0.1387294,1.14636,-0.8522169,0.1024878,-0.2428634,0.4626387,0.4194071,0.2450276,-0.34565,0.661981,-1.336596,-0.3818917,-0.7272429,-0.02174077,-0.1743796,-0.7650572,0.2425739,-1.756004,-0.8012988,-1.14665,-0.4411479,-0.5906776,0.4169534,-1.581624,-0.6269193,-0.9722705,-0.2667684,1.007631,-0.9909463,-0.03624162,-0.3815928,0.3239093,-1.998577,-1.043873,-1.389224,-0.6837218,0.9547047,0.6093535,1.314856,-0.3453512,0.3601509,0.7055021

"1761","AT4G36380","ROT3","Encodes a cytochrome P-450 gene that is involved in leaf blade expansion by controlling polar cell expansion in the leaf length direction. Member of the CYP90C CYP450 family. ROT3 was shown to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis, most likely in the conversion step of typhasterol (TY) to castasterone (CS). As 6-deoxo-CS was unable to restore the phenotype of rot3-1, it has been postulated that ROT3 might be specifically involved in the conversion of TY to CS in the C6-oxidation pathway of brassinolide.

"1889","AT5G10480","PAS2","Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like involved in cell division and differentiation. Interacts with CDKA;1 only in its phosphorylated form, preventing dephosphorylation. Overexpression slowed down cell division in suspension cell cultures at the G2-to-M transition and early  mitosis and inhibited Arabidopsis seedling growth. Localized in  the cytoplasm of dividing cells but moved into the nucleus upon cell differentiation. Based on complementation of yeast mutant PAS2 has acyl-CoA dehydratase activity. It interacts with CER10, a component of the microsomal fatty acid elongase complex, suggesting a role in synthesis of VLCFAs (very long chain fatty acids).","NM_001085097",830912,"3702.AT5G10480.3","GO:0009987",-0.6521424,-0.5459359,-0.4200454,-0.3151764,-0.1928379,-0.285649,-0.6668681,-0.6198646,-0.7691829,-0.4222463,-0.9123928,0.1062065,0.2320971,0.336966,0.4593045,0.3664934,-0.01472572,0.03227782,-0.1170405,0.2298961,-0.2602504,0.1258905,0.2307595,0.353098,0.2602868,-0.1209323,-0.07392871,-0.2232471,0.1236896,-0.3664569,0.104869,0.2272075,0.1343963,-0.2468228,-0.1998192,-0.3491376,-0.002200912,-0.4923475,0.1223385,0.02952736,-0.3516917,-0.3046882,-0.4540065,-0.1070699,-0.5972164,-0.09281114,-0.4740302,-0.4270267,-0.576345,-0.2294084,-0.7195549,-0.3812191,-0.3342156,-0.4835339,-0.1365972,-0.6267438,0.04700354,-0.1023148,0.2446219,-0.2455247,-0.1493184,0.1976183,-0.2925282,0.3469367,-0.1432099,-0.4901466,0.6521424,0.5459359,0.4200454,0.3151764,0.1928379,0.285649,0.6668681,0.6198646,0.7691829,0.4222463,0.9123928,-0.1062065,-0.2320971,-0.336966,-0.4593045,-0.3664934,0.01472572,-0.03227782,0.1170405,-0.2298961,0.2602504,-0.1258905,-0.2307595,-0.353098,-0.2602868,0.1209323,0.07392871,0.2232471,-0.1236896,0.3664569,-0.104869,-0.2272075,-0.1343963,0.2468228,0.1998192,0.3491376,0.002200912,0.4923475,-0.1223385,-0.02952736,0.3516917,0.3046882,0.4540065,0.1070699,0.5972164,0.09281114,0.4740302,0.4270267,0.576345,0.2294084,0.7195549,0.3812191,0.3342156,0.4835339,0.1365972,0.6267438,-0.04700354,0.1023148,-0.2446219,0.2455247,0.1493184,-0.1976183,0.2925282,-0.3469367,0.1432099,0.4901466

"1966","AT5G18170","GDH1","Encodes the 43 kDa alpha-subunit of the glutamate dehydrogenase with a putative mitochondrial transit polypeptide and NAD(H)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-binding domains. Mitochondrial localization confirmed by subcellular fractionation. Combines in several ratios with GDH2 protein (GDH-beta) to form seven isoenzymes. Catalyzes the cleavage of glycine residues. May be involved in ammonia assimilation under conditions of inorganic nitrogen excess. The enzyme is almost exclusively found in the mitochondria of stem and leaf companion cells.","NM_121822",831935,"3702.AT5G18170.1","GO:0003824, GO:0006520, GO:0008152, GO:0009063, GO:0016491, GO:0044238",0.3666129,0.03288973,0.4137538,-0.3624145,-0.01721387,-0.1313827,1.076221,0.4684545,1.002194,0.3902454,0.7315924,-0.3337232,0.04714083,-0.7290274,-0.3838268,-0.4979956,0.7096084,0.1018416,0.6355815,0.02363249,0.3649794,0.380864,-0.3953042,-0.0501036,-0.1642724,1.043332,0.4355648,0.9693047,0.3573557,0.6987026,-0.7761682,-0.4309676,-0.5451364,0.6624675,0.05470075,0.5884407,-0.02350834,0.3178386,0.3452006,0.2310318,1.438636,0.830869,1.364609,0.7526599,1.094007,-0.1141688,1.093435,0.4856684,1.019408,0.4074593,0.7488062,1.207604,0.5998372,1.133577,0.5216281,0.862975,-0.6077668,-0.07402686,-0.6859759,-0.3446289,0.5337399,-0.07820909,0.2631378,-0.611949,-0.2706021,0.3413469,-0.3666129,-0.03288973,-0.4137538,0.3624145,0.01721387,0.1313827,-1.076221,-0.4684545,-1.002194,-0.3902454,-0.7315924,0.3337232,-0.04714083,0.7290274,0.3838268,0.4979956,-0.7096084,-0.1018416,-0.6355815,-0.02363249,-0.3649794,-0.380864,0.3953042,0.0501036,0.1642724,-1.043332,-0.4355648,-0.9693047,-0.3573557,-0.6987026,0.7761682,0.4309676,0.5451364,-0.6624675,-0.05470075,-0.5884407,0.02350834,-0.3178386,-0.3452006,-0.2310318,-1.438636,-0.830869,-1.364609,-0.7526599,-1.094007,0.1141688,-1.093435,-0.4856684,-1.019408,-0.4074593,-0.7488062,-1.207604,-0.5998372,-1.133577,-0.5216281,-0.862975,0.6077668,0.07402686,0.6859759,0.3446289,-0.5337399,0.07820909,-0.2631378,0.611949,0.2706021,-0.3413469

"2072","AT5G37770","CML24","Encodes a protein with 40% similarity to calmodulin. Binds Ca(2+) and, as a consequence, undergoes conformational changes. CML24 expression occurs in all major organs, and transcript levels are increased from 2- to 15-fold in  plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat,  cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid  (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid. However, CML24 protein accumulation changes were not  detectable. The putative CML24 regulatory region confers reporter expression at sites  of predicted mechanical stress; in regions undergoing growth; in vascular tissues and  various floral organs; and in stomata, trichomes, and hydathodes. CML24-underexpressing transgenics are resistant to ABA inhibition of germination and seedling growth, are defective in long-day induction of flowering, and have enhanced tolerance to CoCl(2), molybdic acid, ZnSO(4), and MgCl(2).

The atU2AF35b protein and its homolog, atU2AF35a, contain most of the conserved domains of hsU2AF35, including the psiRRM, one RS domain, two zinc fingers, and the two regions for interacting with U2AF large subunit. Both proteins lack the stretch of glycines present in human U2AF35. The sequences are overall 83% identical, and each Arabidopsis homolog shows approximately 70% similarity to hsU2AF35.    U2AF(35) homologs were also identified from maize, rice and other plants with large-scale EST projects. Both genes are expressed in all major tissues, with atU2AF(35)a expressed at a higher level than atU2AF(35)b in most tissues. The expression patterns were different in roots: atU2AF(35)b expressed strongly in whole young roots and root tips and atU2AF(35)a limited to root vascular regions.","NM_123647",834293,"3702.AT5G42820.1","GO:0000398, GO:0003676, GO:0003723, GO:0005488, GO:0006139, GO:0006397, GO:0008152, GO:0016070, GO:0030529, GO:0044238, GO:0032991",0.05309793,0.07307418,0.09549942,-0.291429,-0.3869089,-0.08369586,0.3418578,-0.1871006,0.1833467,0.09872003,0.1811205,0.01997625,0.04240149,-0.3445269,-0.4400068,-0.1367938,0.2887599,-0.2401985,0.1302488,0.0456221,0.1280226,0.02242524,-0.3645031,-0.4599831,-0.15677,0.2687837,-0.2601748,0.1102725,0.02564585,0.1080463,-0.3869284,-0.4824083,-0.1791953,0.2463584,-0.2826,0.08784728,0.003220609,0.0856211,-0.09547992,0.2077331,0.6332868,0.1043284,0.4747757,0.390149,0.4725495,0.303213,0.7287667,0.1998083,0.5702556,0.4856289,0.5680294,0.4255537,-0.1034047,0.2670426,0.1824159,0.2648164,-0.5289584,-0.1585111,-0.2431378,-0.1607373,0.3704473,0.2858206,0.3682211,-0.08462667,-0.002226183,0.08240049,-0.05309793,-0.07307418,-0.09549942,0.291429,0.3869089,0.08369586,-0.3418578,0.1871006,-0.1833467,-0.09872003,-0.1811205,-0.01997625,-0.04240149,0.3445269,0.4400068,0.1367938,-0.2887599,0.2401985,-0.1302488,-0.0456221,-0.1280226,-0.02242524,0.3645031,0.4599831,0.15677,-0.2687837,0.2601748,-0.1102725,-0.02564585,-0.1080463,0.3869284,0.4824083,0.1791953,-0.2463584,0.2826,-0.08784728,-0.003220609,-0.0856211,0.09547992,-0.2077331,-0.6332868,-0.1043284,-0.4747757,-0.390149,-0.4725495,-0.303213,-0.7287667,-0.1998083,-0.5702556,-0.4856289,-0.5680294,-0.4255537,0.1034047,-0.2670426,-0.1824159,-0.2648164,0.5289584,0.1585111,0.2431378,0.1607373,-0.3704473,-0.2858206,-0.3682211,0.08462667,0.002226183,-0.08240049

"2125","AT5G44610","MAP18","Encodes a protein with seven repeated VEEKK motifs. RNAi and overexpression experiments suggest that the gene is not involved in cell division but might be consequential for cell shape of epidermal and cortical cells. The protein encoded by this gene binds to cortical microtubules and inhibits tubulin polymerization.

"2241","AT5G57090","AGR","Encodes an auxin efflux carrier that is similar to bacterial membrane transporters. Root-specific role in the transport of auxin. Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation resulted in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Protein turnover is affected by the proteasome and by endosomal cycling. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors.

"2254","AT5G58230","ATMSI1","Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.","NM_125208",835935,"3702.AT5G58230.1","GO:0000398, GO:0004872, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006325, GO:0006397, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006996, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0016043, GO:0016070, GO:0043574, GO:0044238, GO:0051179",-0.03760865,-0.1051371,-0.117429,0.1043143,0.093704,0.1282017,-0.0894006,0.02775851,-0.08048272,-0.1832161,-0.529225,-0.06752841,-0.07982033,0.141923,0.1313126,0.1658103,-0.05179196,0.06536716,-0.04287407,-0.1456075,-0.4916164,-0.01229192,0.2094514,0.1988411,0.2333387,0.01573646,0.1328956,0.02465434,-0.07807904,-0.424088,0.2217433,0.211133,0.2456306,0.02802838,0.1451875,0.03694626,-0.06578712,-0.411796,-0.01061031,0.02388736,-0.1937149,-0.07655579,-0.184797,-0.2875304,-0.6335393,0.03449767,-0.1831046,-0.06594549,-0.1741867,-0.2769201,-0.622929,-0.2176023,-0.1004432,-0.2086844,-0.3114178,-0.6574267,0.1171591,0.008917883,-0.0938155,-0.4398244,-0.1082412,-0.2109746,-0.5569835,-0.1027334,-0.4487423,-0.3460089,0.03760865,0.1051371,0.117429,-0.1043143,-0.093704,-0.1282017,0.0894006,-0.02775851,0.08048272,0.1832161,0.529225,0.06752841,0.07982033,-0.141923,-0.1313126,-0.1658103,0.05179196,-0.06536716,0.04287407,0.1456075,0.4916164,0.01229192,-0.2094514,-0.1988411,-0.2333387,-0.01573646,-0.1328956,-0.02465434,0.07807904,0.424088,-0.2217433,-0.211133,-0.2456306,-0.02802838,-0.1451875,-0.03694626,0.06578712,0.411796,0.01061031,-0.02388736,0.1937149,0.07655579,0.184797,0.2875304,0.6335393,-0.03449767,0.1831046,0.06594549,0.1741867,0.2769201,0.622929,0.2176023,0.1004432,0.2086844,0.3114178,0.6574267,-0.1171591,-0.008917883,0.0938155,0.4398244,0.1082412,0.2109746,0.5569835,0.1027334,0.4487423,0.3460089

"2269","AT5G59820","AtZAT12","Encodes a zinc finger protein involved in high light and cold acclimation. Overexpression of this putative transcription factor increases the expression level of 9 cold-responsive genes and represses the expression level of 15 cold-responsive genes, including CBF genes. Also, lines overexpressing this gene exhibits a small but reproducible increase in freeze tolerance. Because of the repression of the CBF genes by the overexpression of this gene, the authors speculate that this gene may be involved in negative regulatory circuit of the CBF pathway.","NM_125374",836103,NA,"GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, NA",0.1069463,1.466276,3.29478,0.5399384,1.722446,-0.8521595,2.743637,1.333262,2.201305,0.4203342,4.59639,1.35933,3.187834,0.4329921,1.6155,-0.9591057,2.636691,1.226316,2.094359,0.313388,4.489444,1.828504,-0.9263377,0.25617,-2.318436,1.277361,-0.1330137,0.7350289,-1.045942,3.130114,-2.754842,-1.572334,-4.146939,-0.551143,-1.961518,-1.093475,-2.874446,1.30161,1.182508,-1.392098,2.203699,0.793324,1.661367,-0.1196042,4.056452,-2.574606,1.021191,-0.3891837,0.4788589,-1.302112,2.873944,3.595797,2.185422,3.053465,1.272494,5.44855,-1.410375,-0.542332,-2.323303,1.852753,0.8680426,-0.9129282,3.263128,-1.780971,2.395085,4.176056,-0.1069463,-1.466276,-3.29478,-0.5399384,-1.722446,0.8521595,-2.743637,-1.333262,-2.201305,-0.4203342,-4.59639,-1.35933,-3.187834,-0.4329921,-1.6155,0.9591057,-2.636691,-1.226316,-2.094359,-0.313388,-4.489444,-1.828504,0.9263377,-0.25617,2.318436,-1.277361,0.1330137,-0.7350289,1.045942,-3.130114,2.754842,1.572334,4.146939,0.551143,1.961518,1.093475,2.874446,-1.30161,-1.182508,1.392098,-2.203699,-0.793324,-1.661367,0.1196042,-4.056452,2.574606,-1.021191,0.3891837,-0.4788589,1.302112,-2.873944,-3.595797,-2.185422,-3.053465,-1.272494,-5.44855,1.410375,0.542332,2.323303,-1.852753,-0.8680426,0.9129282,-3.263128,1.780971,-2.395085,-4.176056

DOMINO1 is located in the nucleus.  Arabidopsis embryos carrying the domino1 mutation grow slowly in comparison with wild type embryos and reach only the globular stage at desiccation. The primary defect of the mutation at the cellular level is the large size of the nucleolus that can be observed soon after fertilization in the nuclei of both the embryo and the endosperm.

"2325","AT5G65700","BAM1","Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.","NM_001203695",836699,"3702.AT5G65700.1","GO:0042742, GO:0050896",0.1003726,0.3887745,-0.3186754,0.4689824,-0.2405068,0.3491586,0.4320685,1.246584,0.5272341,0.1388878,0.4206463,0.2884018,-0.419048,0.3686098,-0.3408795,0.2487859,0.3316959,1.146211,0.4268614,0.03851516,0.3202736,-0.7074499,0.08020798,-0.6292813,-0.03961589,0.04329402,0.8578096,0.1384596,-0.2498867,0.0318718,0.7876578,0.07816855,0.667834,0.7507439,1.565259,0.8459095,0.4575632,0.7393217,-0.7094893,-0.1198239,-0.03691396,0.7776016,0.05825163,-0.3300947,-0.04833618,0.5896654,0.6725753,1.487091,0.7677409,0.3793946,0.6611531,0.08290991,0.8974255,0.1780755,-0.2102708,0.07148769,0.8145155,0.09516559,-0.2931807,-0.01142222,-0.71935,-1.107696,-0.8259378,-0.3883463,-0.1065878,0.2817585,-0.1003726,-0.3887745,0.3186754,-0.4689824,0.2405068,-0.3491586,-0.4320685,-1.246584,-0.5272341,-0.1388878,-0.4206463,-0.2884018,0.419048,-0.3686098,0.3408795,-0.2487859,-0.3316959,-1.146211,-0.4268614,-0.03851516,-0.3202736,0.7074499,-0.08020798,0.6292813,0.03961589,-0.04329402,-0.8578096,-0.1384596,0.2498867,-0.0318718,-0.7876578,-0.07816855,-0.667834,-0.7507439,-1.565259,-0.8459095,-0.4575632,-0.7393217,0.7094893,0.1198239,0.03691396,-0.7776016,-0.05825163,0.3300947,0.04833618,-0.5896654,-0.6725753,-1.487091,-0.7677409,-0.3793946,-0.6611531,-0.08290991,-0.8974255,-0.1780755,0.2102708,-0.07148769,-0.8145155,-0.09516559,0.2931807,0.01142222,0.71935,1.107696,0.8259378,0.3883463,0.1065878,-0.2817585

"2329","AT5G65970","ATMLO10","A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO10 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO5, AtMLO7, AtMLO8, and AtMLO9. The gene is expressed in root and cotyledon vascular system, in root-shoot junction and lateral root primordia and in developing siliques, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s","NM_001345729",836727,"3702.AT5G65970.1","GO:0005886, GO:0006950, GO:0016020, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",0.8434368,-0.1998006,0.3106346,0.1217206,2.846873,-0.8501261,0.9357164,0.3198906,0.9144901,-0.2180887,1.10716,-1.043237,-0.5328022,-0.7217162,2.003436,-1.693563,0.09227963,-0.5235462,0.07105332,-1.061526,0.2637234,0.5104352,0.3215211,3.046673,-0.6503255,1.135517,0.5196911,1.114291,-0.01828818,1.306961,-0.188914,2.536238,-1.160761,0.6250818,0.009255922,0.6038555,-0.5287234,0.7965255,2.725152,-0.9718467,0.8139958,0.19817,0.7927695,-0.3398093,0.9854396,-3.696999,-1.911156,-2.526982,-1.932383,-3.064962,-1.739713,1.785842,1.170017,1.764616,0.6320373,1.957286,-0.6158259,-0.02122631,-1.153805,0.1714437,0.5945996,-0.5379793,0.7872696,-1.132579,0.19267,1.325249,-0.8434368,0.1998006,-0.3106346,-0.1217206,-2.846873,0.8501261,-0.9357164,-0.3198906,-0.9144901,0.2180887,-1.10716,1.043237,0.5328022,0.7217162,-2.003436,1.693563,-0.09227963,0.5235462,-0.07105332,1.061526,-0.2637234,-0.5104352,-0.3215211,-3.046673,0.6503255,-1.135517,-0.5196911,-1.114291,0.01828818,-1.306961,0.188914,-2.536238,1.160761,-0.6250818,-0.009255922,-0.6038555,0.5287234,-0.7965255,-2.725152,0.9718467,-0.8139958,-0.19817,-0.7927695,0.3398093,-0.9854396,3.696999,1.911156,2.526982,1.932383,3.064962,1.739713,-1.785842,-1.170017,-1.764616,-0.6320373,-1.957286,0.6158259,0.02122631,1.153805,-0.1714437,-0.5945996,0.5379793,-0.7872696,1.132579,-0.19267,-1.325249
