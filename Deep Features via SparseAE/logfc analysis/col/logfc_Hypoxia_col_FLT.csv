AT1G32640,ATMYC2,"Encodes a MYC-related transcriptional activator with a typical DNA binding domain of a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif. Binds to an extended G-Box promoter motif. Its transcription is induced by dehydration stress and ABA treatment. Negative regulator of blue lightmediated photomorphogenic growth and blue and far-red-lightregulated gene expression.

AT1G70660,MMZ2,"MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.",NM_001198436,843403,3702.AT1G70660.1,"GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006464, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0019538, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0050896",-0.323634,-0.55392,-0.2827357,-0.588843,-0.5840769,-0.9986219,-0.3137059,-0.4144313,-0.2457743,-0.4927431,0.4421514,-0.230286,0.04089829,-0.265209,-0.2604429,-0.6749879,0.009928101,-0.09079732,0.07785974,-0.1691091,0.7657854,0.2711842,-0.034923,-0.03015693,-0.444702,0.2402141,0.1394886,0.3081457,0.06117684,0.9960713,-0.3061072,-0.3013412,-0.7158862,-0.03097019,-0.1316956,0.03696145,-0.2100074,0.7248871,0.004766069,-0.409779,0.2751371,0.1744116,0.3430687,0.09609983,1.030994,-0.414545,0.270371,0.1696456,0.3383026,0.09133377,1.026228,0.684916,0.5841906,0.7528477,0.5058788,1.440773,-0.1007254,0.06793164,-0.1790372,0.7558573,0.1686571,-0.0783118,0.8565827,-0.2469689,0.6879256,0.9348945,0.323634,0.55392,0.2827357,0.588843,0.5840769,0.9986219,0.3137059,0.4144313,0.2457743,0.4927431,-0.4421514,0.230286,-0.04089829,0.265209,0.2604429,0.6749879,-0.009928101,0.09079732,-0.07785974,0.1691091,-0.7657854,-0.2711842,0.034923,0.03015693,0.444702,-0.2402141,-0.1394886,-0.3081457,-0.06117684,-0.9960713,0.3061072,0.3013412,0.7158862,0.03097019,0.1316956,-0.03696145,0.2100074,-0.7248871,-0.004766069,0.409779,-0.2751371,-0.1744116,-0.3430687,-0.09609983,-1.030994,0.414545,-0.270371,-0.1696456,-0.3383026,-0.09133377,-1.026228,-0.684916,-0.5841906,-0.7528477,-0.5058788,-1.440773,0.1007254,-0.06793164,0.1790372,-0.7558573,-0.1686571,0.0783118,-0.8565827,0.2469689,-0.6879256,-0.9348945

AT5G37770,CML24,"Encodes a protein with 40% similarity to calmodulin. Binds Ca(2+) and, as a consequence, undergoes conformational changes. CML24 expression occurs in all major organs, and transcript levels are increased from 2- to 15-fold in  plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat,  cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid  (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid. However, CML24 protein accumulation changes were not  detectable. The putative CML24 regulatory region confers reporter expression at sites  of predicted mechanical stress; in regions undergoing growth; in vascular tissues and  various floral organs; and in stomata, trichomes, and hydathodes. CML24-underexpressing transgenics are resistant to ABA inhibition of germination and seedling growth, are defective in long-day induction of flowering, and have enhanced tolerance to CoCl(2), molybdic acid, ZnSO(4), and MgCl(2).

AT5G59820,AtZAT12,"Encodes a zinc finger protein involved in high light and cold acclimation. Overexpression of this putative transcription factor increases the expression level of 9 cold-responsive genes and represses the expression level of 15 cold-responsive genes, including CBF genes. Also, lines overexpressing this gene exhibits a small but reproducible increase in freeze tolerance. Because of the repression of the CBF genes by the overexpression of this gene, the authors speculate that this gene may be involved in negative regulatory circuit of the CBF pathway.",NM_125374,836103,NA,"GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, NA",0.1069463,1.466276,3.29478,0.5399384,1.722446,-0.8521595,2.743637,1.333262,2.201305,0.4203342,4.59639,1.35933,3.187834,0.4329921,1.6155,-0.9591057,2.636691,1.226316,2.094359,0.313388,4.489444,1.828504,-0.9263377,0.25617,-2.318436,1.277361,-0.1330137,0.7350289,-1.045942,3.130114,-2.754842,-1.572334,-4.146939,-0.551143,-1.961518,-1.093475,-2.874446,1.30161,1.182508,-1.392098,2.203699,0.793324,1.661367,-0.1196042,4.056452,-2.574606,1.021191,-0.3891837,0.4788589,-1.302112,2.873944,3.595797,2.185422,3.053465,1.272494,5.44855,-1.410375,-0.542332,-2.323303,1.852753,0.8680426,-0.9129282,3.263128,-1.780971,2.395085,4.176056,-0.1069463,-1.466276,-3.29478,-0.5399384,-1.722446,0.8521595,-2.743637,-1.333262,-2.201305,-0.4203342,-4.59639,-1.35933,-3.187834,-0.4329921,-1.6155,0.9591057,-2.636691,-1.226316,-2.094359,-0.313388,-4.489444,-1.828504,0.9263377,-0.25617,2.318436,-1.277361,0.1330137,-0.7350289,1.045942,-3.130114,2.754842,1.572334,4.146939,0.551143,1.961518,1.093475,2.874446,-1.30161,-1.182508,1.392098,-2.203699,-0.793324,-1.661367,0.1196042,-4.056452,2.574606,-1.021191,0.3891837,-0.4788589,1.302112,-2.873944,-3.595797,-2.185422,-3.053465,-1.272494,-5.44855,1.410375,0.542332,2.323303,-1.852753,-0.8680426,0.9129282,-3.263128,1.780971,-2.395085,-4.176056
