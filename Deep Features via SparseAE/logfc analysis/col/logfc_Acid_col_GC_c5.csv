"63","AT1G11400","PYM","The PYM gene encodes a protein capable of interacting with MAGO, and Y14, whose orthologs form part of the exon junction complex in animal cells. In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together. But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times. Its nuclear localization signal has not been rigorously defined, but there is evidence for a nuclear export signal between amino acids 171-205 in the C-terminus.","NM_001035946",837682,"3702.AT1G11400.1","",0.159038304,-0.286491593,-0.154837035,-0.121966317,-0.351347809,-0.424505451,0.16961399,0.285117254,0.378746421,0.175686625,0.509638708,-0.445529897,-0.313875339,-0.281004621,-0.510386113,-0.583543755,0.010575686,0.12607895,0.219708117,0.016648321,0.350600404,0.131654558,0.164525276,-0.064856217,-0.138013859,0.456105583,0.571608846,0.665238014,0.462178218,0.7961303,0.032870718,-0.196510774,-0.269668417,0.324451025,0.439954289,0.533583456,0.33052366,0.664475743,-0.229381493,-0.302539135,0.291580307,0.40708357,0.500712738,0.297652942,0.631605024,-0.073157642,0.520961799,0.636465063,0.730094231,0.527034434,0.860986517,0.594119441,0.709622705,0.803251873,0.600192076,0.934144159,0.115503264,0.209132431,0.006072635,0.340024718,0.093629167,-0.109430629,0.224521454,-0.203059796,0.130892286,0.333952083,-0.159038304,0.286491593,0.154837035,0.121966317,0.351347809,0.424505451,-0.16961399,-0.285117254,-0.378746421,-0.175686625,-0.509638708,0.445529897,0.313875339,0.281004621,0.510386113,0.583543755,-0.010575686,-0.12607895,-0.219708117,-0.016648321,-0.350600404,-0.131654558,-0.164525276,0.064856217,0.138013859,-0.456105583,-0.571608846,-0.665238014,-0.462178218,-0.7961303,-0.032870718,0.196510774,0.269668417,-0.324451025,-0.439954289,-0.533583456,-0.33052366,-0.664475743,0.229381493,0.302539135,-0.291580307,-0.40708357,-0.500712738,-0.297652942,-0.631605024,0.073157642,-0.520961799,-0.636465063,-0.730094231,-0.527034434,-0.860986517,-0.594119441,-0.709622705,-0.803251873,-0.600192076,-0.934144159,-0.115503264,-0.209132431,-0.006072635,-0.340024718,-0.093629167,0.109430629,-0.224521454,0.203059796,-0.130892286,-0.333952083

"95","AT1G15750","TPL","Encodes a protein with several WD40 repeats at the C-terminus and predicted protein-protein interaction domains at the N-terminus.  Together with the TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS (TPRs), it is thought to be involved in transcriptional repression of root-promoting genes in the top half of the embryo during the transition stage of embryogenesis.

"111","AT1G18450","ARP4","Encodes a gene similar to actin-related proteins in other organisms. Member of nuclear ARP family of genes. Component  of chromatin remodeling complexes, involved in chromatin-mediated gene regulation.  Phenotype of the arp4-1 mutant allele revealed partial sterility due to defects in anther development. Targeting the distinct, 3' UTR of AtARP4 transcripts with RNA interference caused a drastic reduction in the level of AtARP4 protein expression, and resulted in strong pleiotropic phenotypes such as altered organization of plant organs, early flowering, delayed flower senescence and high levels of sterility. Western blot analysis and immunolabelling demonstrated a clear correlation between reductions in the level of AtARP4 expression and severity of the phenotypes.","NM_101702",838425,"3702.AT1G18450.1",NA,0.132122144,0.052416577,-0.1040249,0.149220448,-0.079249047,0.079350881,0.250548615,-0.013411305,-0.054647185,-0.120009676,-0.312831997,-0.079705567,-0.236147044,0.017098304,-0.211371191,-0.052771263,0.118426471,-0.145533449,-0.186769329,-0.25213182,-0.444954141,-0.156441477,0.096803871,-0.131665624,0.026934304,0.198132038,-0.065827882,-0.107063762,-0.172426253,-0.365248574,0.253245348,0.024775853,0.183375781,0.354573515,0.090613595,0.049377715,-0.015984776,-0.208807097,-0.228469495,-0.069869567,0.101328167,-0.162631753,-0.203867633,-0.269230124,-0.462052445,0.158599928,0.329797662,0.065837743,0.024601862,-0.040760629,-0.23358295,0.171197734,-0.092762186,-0.133998066,-0.199360557,-0.392182878,-0.26395992,-0.3051958,-0.370558291,-0.563380612,-0.04123588,-0.106598371,-0.299420693,-0.065362491,-0.258184813,-0.192822321,-0.132122144,-0.052416577,0.1040249,-0.149220448,0.079249047,-0.079350881,-0.250548615,0.013411305,0.054647185,0.120009676,0.312831997,0.079705567,0.236147044,-0.017098304,0.211371191,0.052771263,-0.118426471,0.145533449,0.186769329,0.25213182,0.444954141,0.156441477,-0.096803871,0.131665624,-0.026934304,-0.198132038,0.065827882,0.107063762,0.172426253,0.365248574,-0.253245348,-0.024775853,-0.183375781,-0.354573515,-0.090613595,-0.049377715,0.015984776,0.208807097,0.228469495,0.069869567,-0.101328167,0.162631753,0.203867633,0.269230124,0.462052445,-0.158599928,-0.329797662,-0.065837743,-0.024601862,0.040760629,0.23358295,-0.171197734,0.092762186,0.133998066,0.199360557,0.392182878,0.26395992,0.3051958,0.370558291,0.563380612,0.04123588,0.106598371,0.299420693,0.065362491,0.258184813,0.192822321

"118","AT1G19350","BES1","Encodes brassinosteroid (BR) signalling protein that accumulates in the nucleus as dephosphorylated form in response to BRs. Is phosphorylated by the BIN2 GSK3 kinase. It synergistically interacts with BIM1 to bind to E box sequences (CANNTG). The protein contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), followed by a highly conserved amino-terminal domain (N) shared by all family members, a BIN2 phosphorylation domain (P), a PEST motif, involved in protein degradation in the absence of BR, and a carboxyl-terminal domain. BES1 can interact with the ELF6 and REF6 Jumonji N/C-domain containing proteins and may direct them to modify histone methylation upstream of some brassinosteroid responsive-genes","NM_001084093",838518,"3702.AT1G19350.3",NA,0.13222252,0.107955789,0.083633792,0.249799359,0.146720804,0.23516931,0.215799143,0.243207044,0.259506978,0.163470342,0.347648279,-0.024266731,-0.048588728,0.117576838,0.014498284,0.10294679,0.083576623,0.110984524,0.127284457,0.031247821,0.215425759,-0.024321997,0.14184357,0.038765015,0.127213521,0.107843354,0.135251255,0.151551189,0.055514553,0.23969249,0.166165566,0.063087012,0.151535518,0.132165351,0.159573252,0.175873185,0.079836549,0.264014487,-0.103078555,-0.014630049,-0.034000216,-0.006592314,0.009707619,-0.086329017,0.09784892,0.088448506,0.069078339,0.09648624,0.112786174,0.016749538,0.200927475,-0.019370167,0.008037734,0.024337668,-0.071698969,0.112478969,0.027407901,0.043707835,-0.052328802,0.131849136,0.016299933,-0.079736703,0.104441235,-0.096036636,0.088141301,0.184177937,-0.13222252,-0.107955789,-0.083633792,-0.249799359,-0.146720804,-0.23516931,-0.215799143,-0.243207044,-0.259506978,-0.163470342,-0.347648279,0.024266731,0.048588728,-0.117576838,-0.014498284,-0.10294679,-0.083576623,-0.110984524,-0.127284457,-0.031247821,-0.215425759,0.024321997,-0.14184357,-0.038765015,-0.127213521,-0.107843354,-0.135251255,-0.151551189,-0.055514553,-0.23969249,-0.166165566,-0.063087012,-0.151535518,-0.132165351,-0.159573252,-0.175873185,-0.079836549,-0.264014487,0.103078555,0.014630049,0.034000216,0.006592314,-0.009707619,0.086329017,-0.09784892,-0.088448506,-0.069078339,-0.09648624,-0.112786174,-0.016749538,-0.200927475,0.019370167,-0.008037734,-0.024337668,0.071698969,-0.112478969,-0.027407901,-0.043707835,0.052328802,-0.131849136,-0.016299933,0.079736703,-0.104441235,0.096036636,-0.088141301,-0.184177937

"129","AT1G20450","ERD10","Encodes a gene induced by low temperature and dehydration. Inhibits e.coli growth while overexpressed. Belongs to the dehydrin protein family, which contains highly conserved stretches of 7-17 residues that are repetitively scattered in their sequences, the K-, S-, Y- and lysine rich segments. LTI29 and LTI30 double overexpressors confer cold tolerance.

"223","AT1G48410","AGO1","Encodes an RNA Slicer that selectively recruits microRNAs and siRNAs.  There is currently no evidence that AGO1 Slicer is in a high molecular weight RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Mutants are defective in post-transcriptional gene silencing and have pleiotropic developmental and morphological defects. Through its action on the  regulation of ARF17 expression, the protein regulates genes involved at the cross talk between auxin and light signaling during adventitious root development. AGO1 seems to be targeted for degradation by silencing suppressor F-box-containing proteins from Turnip yellow virus and Cucurbit aphid-borne yellow virus.","NM_001198240",841262,"3702.AT1G48410.2",NA,0.02782694,0.07138991,-0.2082249,-0.0542138,-0.2715597,-0.1077921,-0.0437513,0.2753472,-0.251849,-0.2111168,-0.5232368,0.04356297,-0.2360518,-0.08204074,-0.2993866,-0.135619,-0.07157825,0.2475203,-0.2796759,-0.2389438,-0.5510637,-0.2796148,-0.1256037,-0.3429496,-0.179182,-0.1151412,0.2039573,-0.3232389,-0.2825067,-0.5946267,0.1540111,-0.06333479,0.1004328,0.1644736,0.4835721,-0.04362409,-0.002891929,-0.3150119,-0.2173459,-0.05357826,0.01046249,0.329561,-0.1976352,-0.156903,-0.469023,0.1637676,0.2278084,0.5469069,0.0197107,0.06044286,-0.2516771,0.06404075,0.3831393,-0.1440569,-0.1033247,-0.4154447,0.3190985,-0.2080977,-0.1673655,-0.4794855,-0.5271962,-0.486464,-0.798584,0.04073216,-0.2713878,-0.31212,-0.02782694,-0.07138991,0.2082249,0.0542138,0.2715597,0.1077921,0.0437513,-0.2753472,0.251849,0.2111168,0.5232368,-0.04356297,0.2360518,0.08204074,0.2993866,0.135619,0.07157825,-0.2475203,0.2796759,0.2389438,0.5510637,0.2796148,0.1256037,0.3429496,0.179182,0.1151412,-0.2039573,0.3232389,0.2825067,0.5946267,-0.1540111,0.06333479,-0.1004328,-0.1644736,-0.4835721,0.04362409,0.002891929,0.3150119,0.2173459,0.05357826,-0.01046249,-0.329561,0.1976352,0.156903,0.469023,-0.1637676,-0.2278084,-0.5469069,-0.0197107,-0.06044286,0.2516771,-0.06404075,-0.3831393,0.1440569,0.1033247,0.4154447,-0.3190985,0.2080977,0.1673655,0.4794855,0.5271962,0.486464,0.798584,-0.04073216,0.2713878,0.31212

"310","AT1G70660","MMZ2","MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination.

"327","AT1G73590","ATPIN1","Encodes an auxin efflux carrier involved in shoot and root development. It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.","NM_106017",843693,"3702.AT1G73590.1","GO:0005215, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005783, GO:0005886, GO:0006810, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009719, GO:0009987, GO:0016020, GO:0022857, GO:0042592, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0051179, GO:0065007, NA",0.3651248,0.0956566,-0.3559429,0.7201051,0.1373801,0.1594951,0.2936461,0.4638733,-0.1751683,0.2183317,-0.2433832,-0.2694681,-0.7210677,0.3549803,-0.2277446,-0.2056296,-0.07147862,0.0987485,-0.5402931,-0.146793,-0.608508,-0.4515995,0.6244484,0.04172352,0.06383853,0.1979895,0.3682167,-0.2708249,0.1226751,-0.3390398,1.076048,0.4933231,0.5154381,0.6495891,0.8198162,0.1807746,0.5742747,0.1125597,-0.5827249,-0.5606099,-0.4264589,-0.2562318,-0.8952734,-0.5017733,-0.9634883,0.02211501,0.156266,0.3264931,-0.3125484,0.08095162,-0.3807634,0.134151,0.3043781,-0.3346635,0.05883661,-0.4028784,0.1702271,-0.4688145,-0.07531439,-0.5370294,-0.6390416,-0.2455415,-0.7072565,0.3935001,-0.06821491,-0.461715,-0.3651248,-0.0956566,0.3559429,-0.7201051,-0.1373801,-0.1594951,-0.2936461,-0.4638733,0.1751683,-0.2183317,0.2433832,0.2694681,0.7210677,-0.3549803,0.2277446,0.2056296,0.07147862,-0.0987485,0.5402931,0.146793,0.608508,0.4515995,-0.6244484,-0.04172352,-0.06383853,-0.1979895,-0.3682167,0.2708249,-0.1226751,0.3390398,-1.076048,-0.4933231,-0.5154381,-0.6495891,-0.8198162,-0.1807746,-0.5742747,-0.1125597,0.5827249,0.5606099,0.4264589,0.2562318,0.8952734,0.5017733,0.9634883,-0.02211501,-0.156266,-0.3264931,0.3125484,-0.08095162,0.3807634,-0.134151,-0.3043781,0.3346635,-0.05883661,0.4028784,-0.1702271,0.4688145,0.07531439,0.5370294,0.6390416,0.2455415,0.7072565,-0.3935001,0.06821491,0.461715

In turn, assembly of PsbR is dependent on the presence of PsbJ.","NM_106555",844245,"3702.AT1G79040.1",NA,-0.0779905,-2.647992,3.496301,-1.21333,1.171211,-2.684755,3.500448,0.6252722,3.295296,-0.75377,3.455907,-2.570002,3.574291,-1.13534,1.249201,-2.606765,3.578438,0.7032627,3.373287,-0.6757795,3.533897,6.144293,1.434662,3.819203,-0.03676331,6.14844,3.273264,5.943288,1.894222,6.103899,-4.709631,-2.32509,-6.181056,0.004146888,-2.871029,-0.2010045,-4.250071,-0.04039429,2.384541,-1.471425,4.713778,1.838603,4.508627,0.4595605,4.669237,-3.855966,2.329237,-0.5459387,2.124085,-1.924981,2.284696,6.185203,3.310028,5.980052,1.930986,6.140662,-2.875176,-0.2051514,-4.254218,-0.04454118,2.670024,-1.379042,2.830634,-4.049066,0.1606102,4.209677,0.0779905,2.647992,-3.496301,1.21333,-1.171211,2.684755,-3.500448,-0.6252722,-3.295296,0.75377,-3.455907,2.570002,-3.574291,1.13534,-1.249201,2.606765,-3.578438,-0.7032627,-3.373287,0.6757795,-3.533897,-6.144293,-1.434662,-3.819203,0.03676331,-6.14844,-3.273264,-5.943288,-1.894222,-6.103899,4.709631,2.32509,6.181056,-0.004146888,2.871029,0.2010045,4.250071,0.04039429,-2.384541,1.471425,-4.713778,-1.838603,-4.508627,-0.4595605,-4.669237,3.855966,-2.329237,0.5459387,-2.124085,1.924981,-2.284696,-6.185203,-3.310028,-5.980052,-1.930986,-6.140662,2.875176,0.2051514,4.254218,0.04454118,-2.670024,1.379042,-2.830634,4.049066,-0.1606102,-4.209677

"375","AT2G01420","ATPIN4","Encodes a putative auxin efflux carrier that is localized in developing and mature root meristems.  It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  A role for AtPIN4 in generating a sink for auxin below the quiescent center of the root meristem that is essential for auxin distribution and patterning is proposed. In the root, PIN4 is detected around the quiescent center and cells surrounding it, and localizes basally in provascular cells. PIN4 expression is upregulated in brassinosteroid-insensitive mutant (PMID 16141452).","NM_001335061",814670,"3702.AT2G01420.2","GO:0005215, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005783, GO:0005886, GO:0006810, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0009719, GO:0009987, GO:0016020, GO:0022857, GO:0042592, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0051179, GO:0065007, NA",0.4398166,0.09356553,0.1420656,0.8196517,-0.2984353,0.3822229,0.7639724,0.8618948,0.9639327,0.4849003,1.097346,-0.3462511,-0.297751,0.379835,-0.7382519,-0.05759376,0.3241558,0.4220781,0.524116,0.04508367,0.6575293,0.04850009,0.7260861,-0.3920008,0.2886573,0.6704069,0.7683292,0.8703672,0.3913348,1.00378,0.677586,-0.4405009,0.2401573,0.6219068,0.7198291,0.8218671,0.3428347,0.9552803,-1.118087,-0.4374288,-0.05567927,0.04224309,0.144281,-0.3347514,0.2776943,0.6806582,1.062408,1.16033,1.262368,0.7833356,1.395781,0.3817495,0.4796719,0.5817098,0.1026774,0.715123,0.09792235,0.1999603,-0.2790721,0.3333735,0.1020379,-0.3769945,0.2354512,-0.4790324,0.1334132,0.6124456,-0.4398166,-0.09356553,-0.1420656,-0.8196517,0.2984353,-0.3822229,-0.7639724,-0.8618948,-0.9639327,-0.4849003,-1.097346,0.3462511,0.297751,-0.379835,0.7382519,0.05759376,-0.3241558,-0.4220781,-0.524116,-0.04508367,-0.6575293,-0.04850009,-0.7260861,0.3920008,-0.2886573,-0.6704069,-0.7683292,-0.8703672,-0.3913348,-1.00378,-0.677586,0.4405009,-0.2401573,-0.6219068,-0.7198291,-0.8218671,-0.3428347,-0.9552803,1.118087,0.4374288,0.05567927,-0.04224309,-0.144281,0.3347514,-0.2776943,-0.6806582,-1.062408,-1.16033,-1.262368,-0.7833356,-1.395781,-0.3817495,-0.4796719,-0.5817098,-0.1026774,-0.715123,-0.09792235,-0.1999603,0.2790721,-0.3333735,-0.1020379,0.3769945,-0.2354512,0.4790324,-0.1334132,-0.6124456

"378","AT2G01570","RGA","Member of the VHIID/DELLA regulatory family. Contains homopolymeric serine and threonine residues, a putative nuclear localization signal, leucine heptad repeats, and an LXXLL motif. Putative transcriptional regulator repressing the gibberellin response and integration of phytohormone signalling. DELLAs repress cell proliferation and expansion that drives plant growth. The protein undergoes degradation in response to GA via the 26S proteasome. RGA1 binds to PIF3 and  inhibits its DNA binding activity and thus affects the expression of PIF3 regulated genes. RGA may be involved in reducing ROS accumulation in response to stress by up-regulating the transcription of superoxide dismutases. Represses GA-induced vegetative growth and floral initiation. Rapidly degraded in response to GA. Involved in fruit and flower development.","NM_126218",814686,"3702.AT1G07530.1","GO:0000003, GO:0001071, GO:0003676, GO:0003677, GO:0003700, GO:0005488, GO:0005622, GO:0005634, GO:0006139, GO:0006351, GO:0006807, GO:0006950, GO:0007154, GO:0007165, GO:0008152, GO:0009058, GO:0009628, GO:0009719, GO:0009987, GO:0016070, GO:0019219, GO:0032501, GO:0032502, GO:0043226, GO:0044238, GO:0044464, GO:0044707, GO:0048731, GO:0050789, GO:0050896, GO:0065007",0.1985535,0.3121703,-0.2882138,0.3684121,0.03881954,0.2453536,0.01184487,0.6401642,0.1054629,0.2085788,0.0255887,0.1136169,-0.4867672,0.1698587,-0.1597339,0.04680013,-0.1867086,0.4416108,-0.0930906,0.01002534,-0.1729648,-0.6003841,0.05624178,-0.2733508,-0.06681674,-0.3003255,0.3279939,-0.2067075,-0.1035915,-0.2865816,0.6566259,0.3270333,0.5335674,0.3000586,0.928378,0.3936766,0.4967926,0.3138025,-0.3295926,-0.1230585,-0.3565673,0.2717521,-0.2629493,-0.1598333,-0.3428234,0.2065341,-0.02697467,0.6013447,0.06664333,0.1697593,-0.01323084,-0.2335087,0.3948106,-0.1398907,-0.03677479,-0.2197649,0.6283194,0.093618,0.1967339,0.01374383,-0.5347014,-0.4315854,-0.6145755,0.1031159,-0.07987417,-0.1829901,-0.1985535,-0.3121703,0.2882138,-0.3684121,-0.03881954,-0.2453536,-0.01184487,-0.6401642,-0.1054629,-0.2085788,-0.0255887,-0.1136169,0.4867672,-0.1698587,0.1597339,-0.04680013,0.1867086,-0.4416108,0.0930906,-0.01002534,0.1729648,0.6003841,-0.05624178,0.2733508,0.06681674,0.3003255,-0.3279939,0.2067075,0.1035915,0.2865816,-0.6566259,-0.3270333,-0.5335674,-0.3000586,-0.928378,-0.3936766,-0.4967926,-0.3138025,0.3295926,0.1230585,0.3565673,-0.2717521,0.2629493,0.1598333,0.3428234,-0.2065341,0.02697467,-0.6013447,-0.06664333,-0.1697593,0.01323084,0.2335087,-0.3948106,0.1398907,0.03677479,0.2197649,-0.6283194,-0.093618,-0.1967339,-0.01374383,0.5347014,0.4315854,0.6145755,-0.1031159,0.07987417,0.1829901

"392","AT2G05710","ACO3","Encodes an aconitase that can catalyze the conversion of citrate to isocitrate through a cis-aconitate intermediate, indicating that it may participate in the TCA cycle and other primary metabolic pathways. The protein is believed to accumulate in the mitochondria and the cytosol. It affects CSD2 (At2g28190 - a superoxide dismutase) transcript levels and may play a role in the response to oxidative stress. One member of the family (ACO1 - At35830) was shown to specifically bind to the 5' UTR of CSD2 in vitro. ACO3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and its phosphorylation state is modulated in response to ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds.","NM_126589",815120,"3702.AT2G05710.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005975, GO:0006091, GO:0006099, GO:0006520, GO:0008152, GO:0008652, GO:0016829, GO:0016836, GO:0044238",0.6857007,0.4215146,0.3800945,0.4562834,0.4051586,0.5893676,0.1427366,1.301516,1.821751,0.8710193,1.229543,-0.2641861,-0.3056061,-0.2294172,-0.280542,-0.0963331,-0.5429641,0.6158155,1.13605,0.1853187,0.5438423,-0.04142007,0.03476883,-0.01635597,0.167853,-0.278778,0.8800016,1.400236,0.4495047,0.8080283,0.0761889,0.02506411,0.209273,-0.2373579,0.9214216,1.441656,0.4909248,0.8494484,-0.05112479,0.1330841,-0.3135468,0.8452327,1.365467,0.4147359,0.7732595,0.1842089,-0.2624221,0.8963575,1.416592,0.4658607,0.8243843,-0.446631,0.7121486,1.232383,0.2816518,0.6401754,1.15878,1.679014,0.7282827,1.086806,0.5202343,-0.4304968,-0.07197322,-0.9507312,-0.5922076,0.3585236,-0.6857007,-0.4215146,-0.3800945,-0.4562834,-0.4051586,-0.5893676,-0.1427366,-1.301516,-1.821751,-0.8710193,-1.229543,0.2641861,0.3056061,0.2294172,0.280542,0.0963331,0.5429641,-0.6158155,-1.13605,-0.1853187,-0.5438423,0.04142007,-0.03476883,0.01635597,-0.167853,0.278778,-0.8800016,-1.400236,-0.4495047,-0.8080283,-0.0761889,-0.02506411,-0.209273,0.2373579,-0.9214216,-1.441656,-0.4909248,-0.8494484,0.05112479,-0.1330841,0.3135468,-0.8452327,-1.365467,-0.4147359,-0.7732595,-0.1842089,0.2624221,-0.8963575,-1.416592,-0.4658607,-0.8243843,0.446631,-0.7121486,-1.232383,-0.2816518,-0.6401754,-1.15878,-1.679014,-0.7282827,-1.086806,-0.5202343,0.4304968,0.07197322,0.9507312,0.5922076,-0.3585236

"514","AT2G36910","ABCB1","Belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Also known as AtMDR1.Possibly regulates auxin-dependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin transport in the root.  Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AT3G28860.  PGP1 mediates cellular efflux of IAA and interacts with PIN genes that may confer an accelerated vectoral component to PGP-mediated transport. The non-polar localization of PGP1 at root and shoot apices, where IAA gradient-driven transport is impaired, may be required to confer directionality to auxin transport in those tissues.","NM_129247",818265,"3702.AT2G36910.1",NA,0.07685274,0.7194014,-0.5302475,0.3760629,-0.5929556,-0.00502807,-0.6380181,0.7471777,-0.1166847,0.1137341,-0.2158514,0.6425487,-0.6071003,0.2992102,-0.6698083,-0.08188081,-0.7148708,0.6703249,-0.1935374,0.03688135,-0.2927041,-1.249649,-0.3433385,-1.312357,-0.7244295,-1.35742,0.02777624,-0.8360861,-0.6056674,-0.9352529,0.9063105,-0.06270804,0.5252195,-0.1077705,1.277425,0.4135629,0.6439816,0.3143961,-0.9690185,-0.381091,-1.014081,0.3711148,-0.4927476,-0.2623288,-0.5919143,0.5879275,-0.04506248,1.340133,0.4762709,0.7066897,0.3771042,-0.63299,0.7522058,-0.1116566,0.1187622,-0.2108233,1.385196,0.5213334,0.7517521,0.4221667,-0.8638623,-0.6334436,-0.9630291,0.2304187,-0.09916675,-0.3295855,-0.07685274,-0.7194014,0.5302475,-0.3760629,0.5929556,0.00502807,0.6380181,-0.7471777,0.1166847,-0.1137341,0.2158514,-0.6425487,0.6071003,-0.2992102,0.6698083,0.08188081,0.7148708,-0.6703249,0.1935374,-0.03688135,0.2927041,1.249649,0.3433385,1.312357,0.7244295,1.35742,-0.02777624,0.8360861,0.6056674,0.9352529,-0.9063105,0.06270804,-0.5252195,0.1077705,-1.277425,-0.4135629,-0.6439816,-0.3143961,0.9690185,0.381091,1.014081,-0.3711148,0.4927476,0.2623288,0.5919143,-0.5879275,0.04506248,-1.340133,-0.4762709,-0.7066897,-0.3771042,0.63299,-0.7522058,0.1116566,-0.1187622,0.2108233,-1.385196,-0.5213334,-0.7517521,-0.4221667,0.8638623,0.6334436,0.9630291,-0.2304187,0.09916675,0.3295855

The true biological substrate(s) of UGT74F2 are not known, but mutant plants lacking UGT74F2 have a decreased level of SAG and SGE.","NM_129944",818986,"3702.AT2G43820.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0008152, GO:0016740, GO:0016757, GO:0043226, GO:0044464",0.03276448,0.9430312,1.459032,-0.09530588,0.6081368,0.4380682,0.6679257,0.1589297,1.025653,0.982526,2.32934,0.9102667,1.426267,-0.1280704,0.5753723,0.4053037,0.6351612,0.1261652,0.9928889,0.9497616,2.296575,0.5160007,-1.038337,-0.3348944,-0.5049629,-0.2751055,-0.7841015,0.08262219,0.03949489,1.386309,-1.554338,-0.8508951,-1.020964,-0.7911061,-1.300102,-0.4333785,-0.4765058,0.8703079,0.7034426,0.5333741,0.7632316,0.2542356,1.120959,1.077832,2.424646,-0.1700686,0.05978893,-0.4492071,0.4175166,0.3743893,1.721203,0.2298575,-0.2791385,0.5875851,0.5444578,1.891272,-0.508996,0.3577276,0.3146004,1.661414,0.8667237,0.8235964,2.17041,-0.0431273,1.303686,1.346814,-0.03276448,-0.9430312,-1.459032,0.09530588,-0.6081368,-0.4380682,-0.6679257,-0.1589297,-1.025653,-0.982526,-2.32934,-0.9102667,-1.426267,0.1280704,-0.5753723,-0.4053037,-0.6351612,-0.1261652,-0.9928889,-0.9497616,-2.296575,-0.5160007,1.038337,0.3348944,0.5049629,0.2751055,0.7841015,-0.08262219,-0.03949489,-1.386309,1.554338,0.8508951,1.020964,0.7911061,1.300102,0.4333785,0.4765058,-0.8703079,-0.7034426,-0.5333741,-0.7632316,-0.2542356,-1.120959,-1.077832,-2.424646,0.1700686,-0.05978893,0.4492071,-0.4175166,-0.3743893,-1.721203,-0.2298575,0.2791385,-0.5875851,-0.5444578,-1.891272,0.508996,-0.3577276,-0.3146004,-1.661414,-0.8667237,-0.8235964,-2.17041,0.0431273,-1.303686,-1.346814

"584","AT2G46370","AtGH3.11","Encodes a jasmonate-amido synthetase that is a member of the GH3 family of proteins. JAR1 catalyzes the formation of a biologically active jasmonyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) conjugate. JA-Ile promotes the interaction between JAZ1 and COI1 in the jasmonate signaling pathway. JAR1 localizes to the cytoplasm and is also a phytochrome A signaling component. JAR1 is an auxin-induced gene. Loss of function mutants are defective in a variety of responses to jasmonic acid. JAR1 has additional enzymatic activities in vitro, (e.g. the ability to synthesize adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate and other JA conjugates), but there are no data to show whether JAR1 catalyzes many of these reactions in vivo. JAR1 is involved in pathogen defense, sensitivity to ozone, and wound responses.","NM_001084600",819244,NA,NA,0.02939904,-0.03712444,0.3699784,0.09267859,0.4386693,0.0488124,0.4362005,-0.1989553,0.5893741,-0.2630526,0.410782,-0.06652347,0.3405794,0.06327955,0.4092702,0.01941336,0.4068014,-0.2283543,0.5599751,-0.2924516,0.3813829,0.4071029,0.129803,0.4757937,0.08593683,0.4733249,-0.1618308,0.6264985,-0.2259281,0.4479064,-0.2772999,0.06869081,-0.321166,0.06622205,-0.5689337,0.2193957,-0.633031,0.04080354,0.3459907,-0.04386619,0.3435219,-0.2916338,0.4966955,-0.3557311,0.3181034,-0.3898569,-0.002468767,-0.6376245,0.1507049,-0.7017218,-0.02788727,0.3873881,-0.2477677,0.5405617,-0.311865,0.3619696,-0.6351557,0.1531736,-0.699253,-0.02541851,0.7883294,-0.0640973,0.6097372,-0.8524267,-0.1785921,0.6738345,-0.02939904,0.03712444,-0.3699784,-0.09267859,-0.4386693,-0.0488124,-0.4362005,0.1989553,-0.5893741,0.2630526,-0.410782,0.06652347,-0.3405794,-0.06327955,-0.4092702,-0.01941336,-0.4068014,0.2283543,-0.5599751,0.2924516,-0.3813829,-0.4071029,-0.129803,-0.4757937,-0.08593683,-0.4733249,0.1618308,-0.6264985,0.2259281,-0.4479064,0.2772999,-0.06869081,0.321166,-0.06622205,0.5689337,-0.2193957,0.633031,-0.04080354,-0.3459907,0.04386619,-0.3435219,0.2916338,-0.4966955,0.3557311,-0.3181034,0.3898569,0.002468767,0.6376245,-0.1507049,0.7017218,0.02788727,-0.3873881,0.2477677,-0.5405617,0.311865,-0.3619696,0.6351557,-0.1531736,0.699253,0.02541851,-0.7883294,0.0640973,-0.6097372,0.8524267,0.1785921,-0.6738345

"686","AT3G13300","VCS","Encodes VCS (VARICOSE).   Involved in mRNA decapping.  VCS forms a mRNA decapping complex with DCP1 (At1g08370) and DCP2 (At5g13570).  Unlike DCP2, VCS itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology.

"831","AT3G51840","ACX4","Encodes a short-chain acyl-CoA oxidase, which catalyzes the first step of peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation during early, post-germinative growth in oilseed species. Null mutants virtually lack short-chain acyl-CoA and are resistant to 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid, which is converted to the herbicide and auxin analogue 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by beta-oxidation. Despite the almost complete loss of short-chain activity, lipid catabolism and seedling growth and establishment was unaltered in the acx4 mutant. However, double mutants in acx3acx4 (acx3 encodes medium chain acyl CoA oxidase) were not viable and arrested during embryogenesis.","NM_115043",824347,"3702.AT3G51840.1","GO:0000166, GO:0003824, GO:0005488, GO:0006629, GO:0006631, GO:0006635, GO:0008152, GO:0009056, GO:0009987, GO:0016491, GO:0042592, GO:0044238, GO:0065007",0.4102949,0.2253079,0.5602371,-0.4198601,0.3191252,-0.2501013,0.825358,0.09149839,0.6377515,0.1197427,0.9024246,-0.1849869,0.1499423,-0.830155,-0.0911697,-0.6603962,0.4150632,-0.3187965,0.2274567,-0.2905522,0.4921297,0.3349292,-0.6451681,0.09381723,-0.4754093,0.6000501,-0.1338095,0.4124436,-0.1055653,0.6771166,-0.9800973,-0.241112,-0.8103384,0.2651209,-0.4687387,0.07751441,-0.4404944,0.3421875,0.7389853,0.1697588,1.245218,0.5113585,1.057612,0.5396028,1.322285,-0.5692265,0.5062329,-0.2276268,0.3186264,-0.1993825,0.5832994,1.075459,0.3415997,0.8878529,0.369844,1.152526,-0.7338596,-0.1876065,-0.7056154,0.07706655,0.5462531,0.02824427,0.8109262,-0.5180089,0.264673,0.7826819,-0.4102949,-0.2253079,-0.5602371,0.4198601,-0.3191252,0.2501013,-0.825358,-0.09149839,-0.6377515,-0.1197427,-0.9024246,0.1849869,-0.1499423,0.830155,0.0911697,0.6603962,-0.4150632,0.3187965,-0.2274567,0.2905522,-0.4921297,-0.3349292,0.6451681,-0.09381723,0.4754093,-0.6000501,0.1338095,-0.4124436,0.1055653,-0.6771166,0.9800973,0.241112,0.8103384,-0.2651209,0.4687387,-0.07751441,0.4404944,-0.3421875,-0.7389853,-0.1697588,-1.245218,-0.5113585,-1.057612,-0.5396028,-1.322285,0.5692265,-0.5062329,0.2276268,-0.3186264,0.1993825,-0.5832994,-1.075459,-0.3415997,-0.8878529,-0.369844,-1.152526,0.7338596,0.1876065,0.7056154,-0.07706655,-0.5462531,-0.02824427,-0.8109262,0.5180089,-0.264673,-0.7826819

The gene functionally complements yeast calmodulin 1 (CAM1) but only  when selected against the plasmid harboring wild-type yeast sequences. Also the protein does not form formed a complex with a basic amphiphilic helical peptide in the presence of Ca2+ in vitro. Authors suggest that this gene may represent a Ca2+-binding sensor protein that interacts with a more limited set of target proteins than do more conventional CaM isoforms.

"860","AT3G54260","TBL36","Encodes a member of the TBL (TRICHOME BIREFRINGENCE-LIKE) gene family containing a plant-specific DUF231 (domain of unknown function) domain. TBL gene family has 46 members, two of which (TBR/AT5G06700 and TBL3/AT5G01360) have been shown to be involved in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, presumably by influencing the esterification state of pectic polymers. A nomenclature for this gene family has been proposed (Volker Bischoff & Wolf Scheible, 2010, personal communication).","NM_115286",824593,"3702.AT3G54260.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005622, GO:0005737, GO:0005794, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0016407, GO:0016740, GO:0016746, GO:0043226, GO:0044464, GO:0071840",-0.06610463,-0.3831103,-0.6700707,0.2194088,-0.8334558,-0.2150826,0.04802585,0.4945537,0.3531847,0.1448537,0.3548412,-0.3170057,-0.6039661,0.2855135,-0.7673512,-0.148978,0.1141305,0.5606583,0.4192894,0.2109584,0.4209459,-0.2869604,0.6025191,-0.4503455,0.1680277,0.4311362,0.877664,0.736295,0.527964,0.7379515,0.8894796,-0.1633851,0.4549881,0.7180966,1.164624,1.023255,0.8149245,1.024912,-1.052865,-0.4344914,-0.171383,0.2751448,0.1337759,-0.07455509,0.1354324,0.6183732,0.8814817,1.328009,1.186641,0.9783095,1.188297,0.2631085,0.7096363,0.5682673,0.3599363,0.5699238,0.4465278,0.3051589,0.09682788,0.3068154,-0.1413689,-0.3496999,-0.1397124,-0.208331,0.001656505,0.2099875,0.06610463,0.3831103,0.6700707,-0.2194088,0.8334558,0.2150826,-0.04802585,-0.4945537,-0.3531847,-0.1448537,-0.3548412,0.3170057,0.6039661,-0.2855135,0.7673512,0.148978,-0.1141305,-0.5606583,-0.4192894,-0.2109584,-0.4209459,0.2869604,-0.6025191,0.4503455,-0.1680277,-0.4311362,-0.877664,-0.736295,-0.527964,-0.7379515,-0.8894796,0.1633851,-0.4549881,-0.7180966,-1.164624,-1.023255,-0.8149245,-1.024912,1.052865,0.4344914,0.171383,-0.2751448,-0.1337759,0.07455509,-0.1354324,-0.6183732,-0.8814817,-1.328009,-1.186641,-0.9783095,-1.188297,-0.2631085,-0.7096363,-0.5682673,-0.3599363,-0.5699238,-0.4465278,-0.3051589,-0.09682788,-0.3068154,0.1413689,0.3496999,0.1397124,0.208331,-0.001656505,-0.2099875

"873","AT3G55360","ATTSC13","Enoyl-CoA reductase is involved in all very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) elongation reactions that are required for cuticular wax, storage lipid and sphingolipid metabolism. The protein is located in the ER, but in contrast to its yeast homolog TSC13 is not particularly enriched in the nuclear envelope-vacuole junction. Mutants in this gene show abnormal organ morphology and stem glossiness. Cells in all tissues are only about 1/3 of the size of wild type cells. The morphological changes are most likely to result from the reduction in the VLCFA content of sphingolipids.

"1202","AT5G10480","PAS2","Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like involved in cell division and differentiation. Interacts with CDKA;1 only in its phosphorylated form, preventing dephosphorylation. Overexpression slowed down cell division in suspension cell cultures at the G2-to-M transition and early  mitosis and inhibited Arabidopsis seedling growth. Localized in  the cytoplasm of dividing cells but moved into the nucleus upon cell differentiation. Based on complementation of yeast mutant PAS2 has acyl-CoA dehydratase activity.

RHF2a is expressed in all four floral whorls and is present at ~8-fold higher levels than RHF1a in inflorescences by RT-PCR analyses.","NM_001343714",832260,"3702.AT5G22000.1",NA,0.295803,0.08106124,0.3584165,-0.3418938,-0.005894816,-0.317245,0.4872914,0.5733692,0.6408603,0.4054038,1.345299,-0.2147417,0.06261357,-0.6376968,-0.3016978,-0.6130479,0.1914885,0.2775662,0.3450574,0.1096009,1.049496,0.2773553,-0.422955,-0.08695605,-0.3983062,0.4062302,0.4923079,0.5597991,0.3243426,1.264238,-0.7003103,-0.3643113,-0.6756615,0.1288749,0.2149526,0.2824438,0.04698729,0.9868823,0.335999,0.02464882,0.8291852,0.915263,0.9827541,0.7472976,1.687193,-0.3113502,0.4931862,0.579264,0.6467551,0.4112986,1.351194,0.8045364,0.8906141,0.9581053,0.7226488,1.662544,0.08607775,0.1535689,-0.0818876,0.8580074,0.06749115,-0.1679653,0.7719297,-0.2354565,0.7044385,0.939895,-0.295803,-0.08106124,-0.3584165,0.3418938,0.005894816,0.317245,-0.4872914,-0.5733692,-0.6408603,-0.4054038,-1.345299,0.2147417,-0.06261357,0.6376968,0.3016978,0.6130479,-0.1914885,-0.2775662,-0.3450574,-0.1096009,-1.049496,-0.2773553,0.422955,0.08695605,0.3983062,-0.4062302,-0.4923079,-0.5597991,-0.3243426,-1.264238,0.7003103,0.3643113,0.6756615,-0.1288749,-0.2149526,-0.2824438,-0.04698729,-0.9868823,-0.335999,-0.02464882,-0.8291852,-0.915263,-0.9827541,-0.7472976,-1.687193,0.3113502,-0.4931862,-0.579264,-0.6467551,-0.4112986,-1.351194,-0.8045364,-0.8906141,-0.9581053,-0.7226488,-1.662544,-0.08607775,-0.1535689,0.0818876,-0.8580074,-0.06749115,0.1679653,-0.7719297,0.2354565,-0.7044385,-0.939895

The atU2AF35b protein and its homolog, atU2AF35a, contain most of the conserved domains of hsU2AF35, including the psiRRM, one RS domain, two zinc fingers, and the two regions for interacting with U2AF large subunit. Both proteins lack the stretch of glycines present in human U2AF35. The sequences are overall 83% identical, and each Arabidopsis homolog shows approximately 70% similarity to hsU2AF35.    U2AF(35) homologs were also identified from maize, rice and other plants with large-scale EST projects. Both genes are expressed in all major tissues, with atU2AF(35)a expressed at a higher level than atU2AF(35)b in most tissues. The expression patterns were different in roots: atU2AF(35)b expressed strongly in whole young roots and root tips and atU2AF(35)a limited to root vascular regions.","NM_123647",834293,"3702.AT5G42820.1","GO:0000398, GO:0003676, GO:0003723, GO:0005488, GO:0006139, GO:0006397, GO:0008152, GO:0016070, GO:0030529, GO:0044238, GO:0032991",0.05309793,0.07307418,0.09549942,-0.291429,-0.3869089,-0.08369586,0.3418578,-0.1871006,0.1833467,0.09872003,0.1811205,0.01997625,0.04240149,-0.3445269,-0.4400068,-0.1367938,0.2887599,-0.2401985,0.1302488,0.0456221,0.1280226,0.02242524,-0.3645031,-0.4599831,-0.15677,0.2687837,-0.2601748,0.1102725,0.02564585,0.1080463,-0.3869284,-0.4824083,-0.1791953,0.2463584,-0.2826,0.08784728,0.003220609,0.0856211,-0.09547992,0.2077331,0.6332868,0.1043284,0.4747757,0.390149,0.4725495,0.303213,0.7287667,0.1998083,0.5702556,0.4856289,0.5680294,0.4255537,-0.1034047,0.2670426,0.1824159,0.2648164,-0.5289584,-0.1585111,-0.2431378,-0.1607373,0.3704473,0.2858206,0.3682211,-0.08462667,-0.002226183,0.08240049,-0.05309793,-0.07307418,-0.09549942,0.291429,0.3869089,0.08369586,-0.3418578,0.1871006,-0.1833467,-0.09872003,-0.1811205,-0.01997625,-0.04240149,0.3445269,0.4400068,0.1367938,-0.2887599,0.2401985,-0.1302488,-0.0456221,-0.1280226,-0.02242524,0.3645031,0.4599831,0.15677,-0.2687837,0.2601748,-0.1102725,-0.02564585,-0.1080463,0.3869284,0.4824083,0.1791953,-0.2463584,0.2826,-0.08784728,-0.003220609,-0.0856211,0.09547992,-0.2077331,-0.6332868,-0.1043284,-0.4747757,-0.390149,-0.4725495,-0.303213,-0.7287667,-0.1998083,-0.5702556,-0.4856289,-0.5680294,-0.4255537,0.1034047,-0.2670426,-0.1824159,-0.2648164,0.5289584,0.1585111,0.2431378,0.1607373,-0.3704473,-0.2858206,-0.3682211,0.08462667,0.002226183,-0.08240049

"1442","AT5G58230","ATMSI1","Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.","NM_125208",835935,"3702.AT5G58230.1","GO:0000398, GO:0004872, GO:0006139, GO:0006259, GO:0006281, GO:0006325, GO:0006397, GO:0006810, GO:0006886, GO:0006996, GO:0008152, GO:0009987, GO:0015031, GO:0016043, GO:0016070, GO:0043574, GO:0044238, GO:0051179",-0.03760865,-0.1051371,-0.117429,0.1043143,0.093704,0.1282017,-0.0894006,0.02775851,-0.08048272,-0.1832161,-0.529225,-0.06752841,-0.07982033,0.141923,0.1313126,0.1658103,-0.05179196,0.06536716,-0.04287407,-0.1456075,-0.4916164,-0.01229192,0.2094514,0.1988411,0.2333387,0.01573646,0.1328956,0.02465434,-0.07807904,-0.424088,0.2217433,0.211133,0.2456306,0.02802838,0.1451875,0.03694626,-0.06578712,-0.411796,-0.01061031,0.02388736,-0.1937149,-0.07655579,-0.184797,-0.2875304,-0.6335393,0.03449767,-0.1831046,-0.06594549,-0.1741867,-0.2769201,-0.622929,-0.2176023,-0.1004432,-0.2086844,-0.3114178,-0.6574267,0.1171591,0.008917883,-0.0938155,-0.4398244,-0.1082412,-0.2109746,-0.5569835,-0.1027334,-0.4487423,-0.3460089,0.03760865,0.1051371,0.117429,-0.1043143,-0.093704,-0.1282017,0.0894006,-0.02775851,0.08048272,0.1832161,0.529225,0.06752841,0.07982033,-0.141923,-0.1313126,-0.1658103,0.05179196,-0.06536716,0.04287407,0.1456075,0.4916164,0.01229192,-0.2094514,-0.1988411,-0.2333387,-0.01573646,-0.1328956,-0.02465434,0.07807904,0.424088,-0.2217433,-0.211133,-0.2456306,-0.02802838,-0.1451875,-0.03694626,0.06578712,0.411796,0.01061031,-0.02388736,0.1937149,0.07655579,0.184797,0.2875304,0.6335393,-0.03449767,0.1831046,0.06594549,0.1741867,0.2769201,0.622929,0.2176023,0.1004432,0.2086844,0.3114178,0.6574267,-0.1171591,-0.008917883,0.0938155,0.4398244,0.1082412,0.2109746,0.5569835,0.1027334,0.4487423,0.3460089

"1490","AT5G65700","BAM1","Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.","NM_001203695",836699,"3702.AT5G65700.1","GO:0042742, GO:0050896",0.1003726,0.3887745,-0.3186754,0.4689824,-0.2405068,0.3491586,0.4320685,1.246584,0.5272341,0.1388878,0.4206463,0.2884018,-0.419048,0.3686098,-0.3408795,0.2487859,0.3316959,1.146211,0.4268614,0.03851516,0.3202736,-0.7074499,0.08020798,-0.6292813,-0.03961589,0.04329402,0.8578096,0.1384596,-0.2498867,0.0318718,0.7876578,0.07816855,0.667834,0.7507439,1.565259,0.8459095,0.4575632,0.7393217,-0.7094893,-0.1198239,-0.03691396,0.7776016,0.05825163,-0.3300947,-0.04833618,0.5896654,0.6725753,1.487091,0.7677409,0.3793946,0.6611531,0.08290991,0.8974255,0.1780755,-0.2102708,0.07148769,0.8145155,0.09516559,-0.2931807,-0.01142222,-0.71935,-1.107696,-0.8259378,-0.3883463,-0.1065878,0.2817585,-0.1003726,-0.3887745,0.3186754,-0.4689824,0.2405068,-0.3491586,-0.4320685,-1.246584,-0.5272341,-0.1388878,-0.4206463,-0.2884018,0.419048,-0.3686098,0.3408795,-0.2487859,-0.3316959,-1.146211,-0.4268614,-0.03851516,-0.3202736,0.7074499,-0.08020798,0.6292813,0.03961589,-0.04329402,-0.8578096,-0.1384596,0.2498867,-0.0318718,-0.7876578,-0.07816855,-0.667834,-0.7507439,-1.565259,-0.8459095,-0.4575632,-0.7393217,0.7094893,0.1198239,0.03691396,-0.7776016,-0.05825163,0.3300947,0.04833618,-0.5896654,-0.6725753,-1.487091,-0.7677409,-0.3793946,-0.6611531,-0.08290991,-0.8974255,-0.1780755,0.2102708,-0.07148769,-0.8145155,-0.09516559,0.2931807,0.01142222,0.71935,1.107696,0.8259378,0.3883463,0.1065878,-0.2817585
