"24","AT1G08880","G-H2AX","Encodes HTA5, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 1020 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period.

"69","AT1G27650","ATU2AF35A","U2 auxiliary factor small subunit. The atU2AF35a protein and its homolog, atU2AF35b, contain most of the conserved domains of hsU2AF35, including the psiRRM, one RS domain, two zinc fingers, and the two regions for interacting with U2AF large subunit. Both proteins lack the stretch of glycines present in human U2AF35. The sequences are overall 83% identical, and each Arabidopsis homolog shows approximately 70% similarity to hsU2AF35.    U2AF(35) homologs were also identified from maize, rice and other plants with large-scale EST projects. Both genes are expressed in all major tissues, with atU2AF(35)a expressed at a higher level than atU2AF(35)b in most tissues. The expression patterns were different in roots: atU2AF(35)b expressed strongly in whole young roots and root tips and atU2AF(35)a limited to root vascular regions.","NM_001084140",839657,"3702.AT1G27650.1","GO:0000398, GO:0003676, GO:0003723, GO:0005488, GO:0006139, GO:0006397, GO:0008152, GO:0016070, GO:0030529, GO:0044238, GO:0032991",-0.00428086,0.216210719,-0.140676046,0.017991281,-0.422135823,-0.198696478,0.341358018,0.024841393,0.08108997,0.298665128,0.417773494,0.22049158,-0.136395185,0.022272142,-0.417854962,-0.194415618,0.345638879,0.029122253,0.08537083,0.302945989,0.422054354,-0.356886765,-0.198219438,-0.638346542,-0.414907197,0.125147299,-0.191369326,-0.135120749,0.082454409,0.201562775,0.158667327,-0.281459777,-0.058020432,0.482034064,0.165517438,0.221766015,0.439341174,0.55844954,-0.440127104,-0.216687759,0.323366737,0.006850111,0.063098688,0.280673847,0.399782213,0.223439345,0.763493841,0.446977215,0.503225792,0.720800951,0.839909317,0.540054496,0.223537871,0.279786448,0.497361606,0.616469972,-0.316516626,-0.260268049,-0.04269289,0.076415476,0.056248577,0.273823736,0.392932101,0.217575159,0.336683524,0.119108366,0.00428086,-0.216210719,0.140676046,-0.017991281,0.422135823,0.198696478,-0.341358018,-0.024841393,-0.08108997,-0.298665128,-0.417773494,-0.22049158,0.136395185,-0.022272142,0.417854962,0.194415618,-0.345638879,-0.029122253,-0.08537083,-0.302945989,-0.422054354,0.356886765,0.198219438,0.638346542,0.414907197,-0.125147299,0.191369326,0.135120749,-0.082454409,-0.201562775,-0.158667327,0.281459777,0.058020432,-0.482034064,-0.165517438,-0.221766015,-0.439341174,-0.55844954,0.440127104,0.216687759,-0.323366737,-0.006850111,-0.063098688,-0.280673847,-0.399782213,-0.223439345,-0.763493841,-0.446977215,-0.503225792,-0.720800951,-0.839909317,-0.540054496,-0.223537871,-0.279786448,-0.497361606,-0.616469972,0.316516626,0.260268049,0.04269289,-0.076415476,-0.056248577,-0.273823736,-0.392932101,-0.217575159,-0.336683524,-0.119108366

"102","AT1G54690","G-H2AX","Encodes HTA3, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 1020 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period.

"173","AT2G26300","ATGPA1","Encodes an alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein. The active GTP-bound form of GPA1 binds to the GTG1 and GTG2 abscisic acid (ABA) receptors and appears to affect their GTPase and GTP-binding activity, and hence, ABA binding abilities. GPA1 is a positive regulator in ABA-mediated inhibition of stomatal opening. Plants with recessive mutant alleles have complex phenotypes including: reduced brassinolide response, reduced cell divisions, round leaves, short hypocotyls.

"194","AT2G36060","MMZ3","MMZ3/UEV1C encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1C can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ3/UEV1C transcripts are found at moderate levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen or 2 days after germination.

In Arabidopsis, the RPT5 subunit is encoded by two highly homologous genes, RPT5a and RPT5b.  RPT5a and RPT5b show accession-dependent functional redundancy.  In Wassilewskija (Ws) accession: mutant alleles of RPT5a displayed 50% pollen lethality, indicating that RPT5a is essential for male gametophyte development. In the Columbia (Col) accession, a rpt5a mutant allele did not display such a phenotype because the RPT5b Col allele complements the rpt5a defect in the male gametophyte, whereas the RPT5b Ws allele does not.

Exerts nonredundant, partially overlapping functions with the ABC transporter encoded by AtPGP1.","NM_113807",822519,"3702.AT3G28860.1",NA,0.07524476,0.3307835,-0.4281609,0.4512846,-0.2527365,0.4382581,0.07115669,0.6051104,-0.4159955,-0.1932972,-0.4723344,0.2555388,-0.5034056,0.3760398,-0.3279812,0.3630133,-0.004088073,0.5298657,-0.4912402,-0.268542,-0.5475792,-0.7589444,0.120501,-0.58352,0.1074745,-0.2596269,0.2743269,-0.746779,-0.5240808,-0.8031179,0.8794454,0.1754244,0.8664189,0.4993176,1.033271,0.01216543,0.2348637,-0.04417351,-0.704021,-0.0130265,-0.3801279,0.1538259,-0.86728,-0.6445818,-0.9236189,0.6909945,0.3238932,0.8578469,-0.163259,0.05943925,-0.2195979,-0.3671014,0.1668524,-0.8542535,-0.6315553,-0.9105924,0.5339538,-0.4871521,-0.2644539,-0.5434911,-1.021106,-0.7984077,-1.077445,0.2226982,-0.05633894,-0.2790372,-0.07524476,-0.3307835,0.4281609,-0.4512846,0.2527365,-0.4382581,-0.07115669,-0.6051104,0.4159955,0.1932972,0.4723344,-0.2555388,0.5034056,-0.3760398,0.3279812,-0.3630133,0.004088073,-0.5298657,0.4912402,0.268542,0.5475792,0.7589444,-0.120501,0.58352,-0.1074745,0.2596269,-0.2743269,0.746779,0.5240808,0.8031179,-0.8794454,-0.1754244,-0.8664189,-0.4993176,-1.033271,-0.01216543,-0.2348637,0.04417351,0.704021,0.0130265,0.3801279,-0.1538259,0.86728,0.6445818,0.9236189,-0.6909945,-0.3238932,-0.8578469,0.163259,-0.05943925,0.2195979,0.3671014,-0.1668524,0.8542535,0.6315553,0.9105924,-0.5339538,0.4871521,0.2644539,0.5434911,1.021106,0.7984077,1.077445,-0.2226982,0.05633894,0.2790372

"280","AT3G44310","ATNIT1","Mutants are resistant to indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN). NIT1 catalyzes the terminal activation step in indole-acetic acid biosynthesis. Predominantly expressed isoform of nitrilase isoenzyme family.   Aggregation of NIT1 in cells directly abutting wound sites is one of the earliest events associated with wound and herbicide-induced cell death.  The protein undergoes thiolation following treatment with the  oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide. It is also involved in the conversion of IAN to IAM (indole-3-acetamide) and other non-auxin-related metabolic processes.","NM_001084765",823556,"3702.AT3G44310.1","GO:0003824, GO:0008152, GO:0016787",0.3472985,-0.02404181,1.349117,0.06623771,0.5884981,0.2932968,1.069331,0.4332792,1.412861,0.03739078,1.228266,-0.3713403,1.001818,-0.2810607,0.2411996,-0.05400161,0.7220329,0.08598076,1.065563,-0.3099077,0.880968,1.373159,0.09027952,0.6125399,0.3173387,1.093373,0.457321,1.436903,0.06143259,1.252308,-1.282879,-0.7606188,-1.05582,-0.2797855,-0.9158377,0.0637441,-1.311726,-0.1208505,0.5222604,0.2270591,1.003094,0.3670415,1.346623,-0.02884693,1.162029,-0.2952012,0.4808333,-0.1552189,0.8243629,-0.5511073,0.6397683,0.7760346,0.1399824,1.119564,-0.2559061,0.9349696,-0.6360522,0.3435296,-1.031941,0.158935,0.9795818,-0.3958884,0.7949872,-1.37547,-0.1845946,1.190876,-0.3472985,0.02404181,-1.349117,-0.06623771,-0.5884981,-0.2932968,-1.069331,-0.4332792,-1.412861,-0.03739078,-1.228266,0.3713403,-1.001818,0.2810607,-0.2411996,0.05400161,-0.7220329,-0.08598076,-1.065563,0.3099077,-0.880968,-1.373159,-0.09027952,-0.6125399,-0.3173387,-1.093373,-0.457321,-1.436903,-0.06143259,-1.252308,1.282879,0.7606188,1.05582,0.2797855,0.9158377,-0.0637441,1.311726,0.1208505,-0.5222604,-0.2270591,-1.003094,-0.3670415,-1.346623,0.02884693,-1.162029,0.2952012,-0.4808333,0.1552189,-0.8243629,0.5511073,-0.6397683,-0.7760346,-0.1399824,-1.119564,0.2559061,-0.9349696,0.6360522,-0.3435296,1.031941,-0.158935,-0.9795818,0.3958884,-0.7949872,1.37547,0.1845946,-1.190876

Encodes a mitochondrial uncoupling protein AtUCP1 involved in maintain the redox poise of the mitochondrial electron transport chain to facilitate photosynthetic metabolism.  Disruption of UCP1 results in a photosynthetic phenotype. Specifically there is a restriction in photorespiration with a decrease in the rate of oxidation of photorespiratory glycine in the mitochondrion.

"317","AT4G12420","SKU5","Encodes a protein of unknown function involved in directed root tip growth. It is a member of 19-member gene family and is distantly related structurally to the multiple-copper oxidases ascorbate oxidase and laccase, though it lacks the copper-binding domains. The protein is glycosylated and GPI-anchored. It is localized to the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The gene is expressed most strongly in expanding tissues.","NM_001203775",826851,"3702.AT4G12420.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005488, GO:0005886, GO:0008152, GO:0016020, GO:0016491, GO:0044464",0.302419,0.4353588,-0.03364303,0.707059,0.5376045,0.5273795,-0.06032853,0.2202135,-0.08311952,0.1573674,-0.142271,0.1329397,-0.3360621,0.40464,0.2351855,0.2249605,-0.3627476,-0.08220551,-0.3855386,-0.1450516,-0.44469,-0.4690018,0.2717003,0.1022457,0.09202073,-0.4956873,-0.2151452,-0.5184783,-0.2779913,-0.5776297,0.7407021,0.5712476,0.5610225,-0.02668549,0.2538566,-0.04947649,0.1910105,-0.1086279,-0.1694545,-0.1796795,-0.7673876,-0.4868455,-0.7901786,-0.5496916,-0.84933,-0.01022502,-0.597933,-0.317391,-0.620724,-0.3802371,-0.6798755,-0.587708,-0.307166,-0.610499,-0.3700121,-0.6696505,0.2805421,-0.02279099,0.217696,-0.08194244,-0.3033331,-0.0628461,-0.3624845,0.240487,-0.05915145,-0.2996384,-0.302419,-0.4353588,0.03364303,-0.707059,-0.5376045,-0.5273795,0.06032853,-0.2202135,0.08311952,-0.1573674,0.142271,-0.1329397,0.3360621,-0.40464,-0.2351855,-0.2249605,0.3627476,0.08220551,0.3855386,0.1450516,0.44469,0.4690018,-0.2717003,-0.1022457,-0.09202073,0.4956873,0.2151452,0.5184783,0.2779913,0.5776297,-0.7407021,-0.5712476,-0.5610225,0.02668549,-0.2538566,0.04947649,-0.1910105,0.1086279,0.1694545,0.1796795,0.7673876,0.4868455,0.7901786,0.5496916,0.84933,0.01022502,0.597933,0.317391,0.620724,0.3802371,0.6798755,0.587708,0.307166,0.610499,0.3700121,0.6696505,-0.2805421,0.02279099,-0.217696,0.08194244,0.3033331,0.0628461,0.3624845,-0.240487,0.05915145,0.2996384

"373","AT4G35090","CAT2","Encodes a peroxisomal catalase, highly expressed in bolts and leaves.  mRNA expression patterns show circadian regulation with mRNA levels being high in the subjective early morning. Loss of function mutations have increased H2O2 levels and increased H2O2  sensitivity. Mutants accumulate more toxic ions yet show decreased sensitivity to Li+. This decreased sensitivity is most likely due to an insensitivity to ethylene.  Note that in Queval et al.

PGL3 likely functions in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. pgl3 mutant phenotypes suggest that it is important in pathogen defense and maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis.","NM_122348",832511,"3702.AT5G24400.1","GO:0003824, GO:0005975, GO:0005996, GO:0006098, GO:0008152, GO:0016787, GO:0044238",-0.2738512,-0.3535709,0.1651285,-0.2292649,-0.09238271,0.1442163,-0.2428715,-0.4056356,0.09682206,-0.03761522,0.05290954,-0.07971974,0.4389797,0.04458629,0.1814685,0.4180675,0.0309797,-0.1317845,0.3706732,0.236236,0.3267607,0.5186994,0.124306,0.2611882,0.4977872,0.1106994,-0.05206472,0.450393,0.3159557,0.4064805,-0.3943934,-0.2575112,-0.0209122,-0.408,-0.5707642,-0.06830645,-0.2027437,-0.112219,0.1368822,0.3734812,-0.0136066,-0.1763708,0.3260869,0.1916497,0.2821744,0.236599,-0.1504888,-0.3132529,0.1892048,0.05476749,0.1452922,-0.3870878,-0.549852,-0.04739426,-0.1818315,-0.09130678,-0.1627642,0.3396935,0.2052563,0.295781,0.5024577,0.3680204,0.4585452,-0.1344373,-0.04391252,0.09052476,0.2738512,0.3535709,-0.1651285,0.2292649,0.09238271,-0.1442163,0.2428715,0.4056356,-0.09682206,0.03761522,-0.05290954,0.07971974,-0.4389797,-0.04458629,-0.1814685,-0.4180675,-0.0309797,0.1317845,-0.3706732,-0.236236,-0.3267607,-0.5186994,-0.124306,-0.2611882,-0.4977872,-0.1106994,0.05206472,-0.450393,-0.3159557,-0.4064805,0.3943934,0.2575112,0.0209122,0.408,0.5707642,0.06830645,0.2027437,0.112219,-0.1368822,-0.3734812,0.0136066,0.1763708,-0.3260869,-0.1916497,-0.2821744,-0.236599,0.1504888,0.3132529,-0.1892048,-0.05476749,-0.1452922,0.3870878,0.549852,0.04739426,0.1818315,0.09130678,0.1627642,-0.3396935,-0.2052563,-0.295781,-0.5024577,-0.3680204,-0.4585452,0.1344373,0.04391252,-0.09052476
